Welcome to this interactive problem set. The awareness of climate change rose significantly over the past years. Sorely questioning the moral of the population won't avoid its' highly uncertain effects. Therefore high efforts are made to find technical improvements as well as economical incentitives to avoid long term effects of climate change.   
In this problem set we will approach one possible countermeasure by analysing how carbon pricing would reduce emissions in the electricty sector. The analysis is based on **"Inferring Carbon Abatement Costs in Electricity Markets: A Revealed Preference Approach using the Shale Revolution"** by Joseph A. Cullen, Erin T. Mansur (2016) - further simply referred as Cullen. The paper and further ressources can be downloaded from <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/pol.20150388   target = "_blank"> https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/pol.20150388</a>

You will use the `Statstical Programming Language R` to replicate the analysis. Basic Knowledge is required , but further information on important logic or function will be provided. Furthermore, you are not forced to solve the tasks in order, but it is recommended, since each new task is based on the results of the previous ones. Even if you are a complete novice in R you should not be put off here. You can find useful information

### ReadME


The problem set offers different ways to interact with. Coding exercises are marked as **TASK**. Some only require you to run them, in others you need to complement a small part of the code. Below the different types of interactions with their corresponding functions are explained:   


 - Code Chunks: Require you to complete small parts of Code. The work flow of solving code chunks is intuitive and as follows:
                
  + `edit` : Click to insert your own Code into the chunk.
  + `run chunk`: Runs the chunk and displays the outputs in the corresponding console of the task.
  + `check`: Check your input for correctness.  
&nbsp;

  
  Additional functions:    
                   
  + `data`: Redirects you to the data browser - you can view the data that are loaded.
  + `hint` : Shows a hint to help solve the code chunk.
  + `solution` : Shows the solution of the task.  
&nbsp;

  
 - Quizzes: To give you a feeling of the data we work with, i placed some quizzes to blabal
    
 - Info Boxes: Contain additional information, that provide further information on technical terms and documentation of functions.

## Exercise 1 -- Motivation

The goal of this problem set is to analyse how carbon pricing would effect emission in the energy sector. `Coal` is the **world's biggest source of energy and carbon emissions**, mostly because it is easy to store, transport, doesn't alter and can be mined in huge quantities around the world. This makes it very desirable and cheap to use as a energy source. Given that the coal supply will last for decades, it is a major goal to find incentitives to reduce emissions from coal consumption.  
One alternative to coal is `natural gas`. Even though it is still considered fossil fuel, its emissions and heat density are way superior to coal. Nevertheless, natural gas wasn't considered to be an real alternative to coal  as an energy supplier until the early 2000s due to its higher prices and the more difficult handling.  
This has changed due to the `Shale Revolution`, whereby natural gas was not only a by-product of the oil industry, but could now be extracted in a targeted manner and in large quantities. Lanfrancois (2012) estimates, based on the Clean Power Plan introduced by the Obama administration in 2015, carbon dioxide emissions from the electricity industry could be reduced by 23 to 42 percent by switching existing coal powered generators to gas powered ones.

With this in mind, in `Exercise 1` you will explore various data to get insights in the current situation of the U.S. energy sector. You will look at the distribution of energy sources in the American market, its prices and the generated load over time.
The data sets are provided by ???????




**Task:**
Use the `read.csv` command to *load the data set* and store it in a variable called `PaGP`.
The basic structure of the command is already given in the code chunk as a comment.

info("read.csv() and write.csv()") # Run this line (Strg-Enter) to show info

```{r "1__5"}
# ... <- read.csv("./Data/data_1.csv")
```

```{r "1__6"}
PaGP <- as.data.frame(PaGP)
PaGP$date <- as.Date(PaGP$date)


PaGP <- PaGP %>% 
  select(c(1:5, 10:13))
```



**Task:** Lets take a look at the data we just imported. Use the `head()` command to show the first **eight** rows of the data set. 


```{r "1__7"}
# head(PaGP, ...)
```


Alternatively you can press the `data` button to get redirected to the `Data Explorer` Tab.  
  
The data frame contains monthly numbers of generated MwH with coal and gas as well as prices of Energy commodities. 
Keep in mind that different commodities are traded in different units. Oil is traded in barrels ($/bbl), coal in metric tons ($/mt) and gas in British thermal units($/mmbtu). The natural gas index is set to 100 in the year 2010 and changes accordingly.
Prior to visualizing the data, we should clean the data set. First, as we are just interested in coal and natural gas, the other commodities prices can be removed. Secondly, as mentioned above, commodities are traded in different units. Therefore we will add new entries for normalized prices, which gives us a good cost basis to produce the same amount of energy with each commodity.  On this account, we assume that `1 MwH = 0.454 mT Coal = 3.412 mmBtu Natural Gas`.

The date column is currently stored as a character. To be able visualize the date variable as a continuous variable, we have to convert is. Therefore, R has a build in date class.
**Task:** Just press *check*.

```{r "1__8"}
PaGP <- as.data.frame(PaGP)
PaGP$date <- as.Date(PaGP$date)
```
