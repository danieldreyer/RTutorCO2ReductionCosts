Welcome to this interactive problem set. The awareness of climate change rose significantly over the past years. Purely questioning the moral of the population though, won't avoid its' highly uncertain effects. Therefore high efforts are made to find technical improvements as well as economical incentitives to avoid long term effects of climate change.   
In this problem set we will approach one possible countermeasure by analysing how carbon pricing would reduce emissions in the electricty sector. The analysis is based on **"Inferring Carbon Abatement Costs in Electricity Markets: A Revealed Preference Approach using the Shale Revolution"** by Joseph A. Cullen, Erin T. Mansur (2016) - further simply referred as Cullen. The paper and further ressources can be downloaded from <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/pol.20150388   target = "_blank"> https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/pol.20150388</a>

You will use the `Statstical Programming Language R` to replicate the analysis. Basic knowledge of `R` is required, but information on important function will be provided. 
Since each new exercise inherits the results of previous exercises, it is recommendated to solve them in order. However you are free to skip to any exercise you like if you feel so.  
If you are a complete novice in `R` you should not feel left behind. Understanding the basic concepts is straight forward, you can find useful information [here](https://cran.r-project.org/manuals.html).

### ReadME


The problem set offers different ways to interact with it. Coding exercises are marked as **TASK**. Some only need to be run, for others you need to complement a small part of the code, which is noted in the task description. Below you can read about the different types of interactions with their corresponding functions:   


 - Code Chunks: Require you to complete small parts of Code. The work flow of solving code chunks is intuitive and as follows:
                
  + `edit` : Click to insert your own Code into the chunk.
  + `run chunk`: Runs the chunk and displays outputs or errors in the corresponding console.
  + `check`: Check your input for against the solution.
  + `hint` : Should you have problem to solve a task, you can request a hint.  
&nbsp;

  
  Additional functions:    
                   
  + `data`: Redirects you to the data browser - you can view the loaded data with the help of an interface.
  + `solution` : Shows the solution of the task.  
&nbsp;

  
 - Quizzes: Evaluate your knownledge of topics before we dive in our analysis.
    
 - Info Boxes: Contain additional information on technical terms or documentation of functions.

## Exercise 1 -- Motivation

`Coal` is the **world's biggest source of energy and carbon emissions**, mostly because it is easy to store, transport, doesn't alter and can be mined in huge quantities around the world. This makes it desirable and cheap to use as a energy source. Given that the coal supply will last for decades, it is a major goal to find incentitives to reduce emissions from coal consumption.  
One alternative to coal is `natural gas`. Even though still being a fossil fuel, its' emissions and heat density are way superior to coal. Nevertheless, natural gas wasn't considered to be an real alternative to coal because to its higher prices more difficult handling up until the early 2000s.  
This changed due to the `Shale Revolution`, whereby natural gas was not only a by-product of the oil industry, but could now be extracted in a targeted manner and in large quantities. Lanfrancois (2012) estimates, that based on the Clean Power Plan introduced by the Obama administration in 2015, carbon dioxide emissions from the electricity industry could be reduced by 23 to 42 percent by switching existing coal powered generators to gas powered ones.

With this in mind, in `Exercise 1` you will explore data to get insights in the current situation of the U.S. energy sector. You will look at the distribution of energy sources in the American market, its prices and the generated load over time.  

**Task:**
Use the `read_csv` command to *load the data set* and store it in a variable called `PaGP`.
The basic structure of the command is already given in the code chunk as a comment.

info("read.csv() and write.csv()") # Run this line (Strg-Enter) to show info

```{r "1__5"}
# ... <- read_csv("./Data/PaGP.csv")
PaGP <- read_csv("./Data/PaGP.csv")
```


**Task:** Lets take a look at the data we just imported. Use the `head()` command to show the first **eight** rows of the data set. 


```{r "1__6"}
# head(PaGP, ...)
head(PaGP, 8)

```


Alternatively you can press the `data` button to get redirected to the `Data Explorer` Tab. 

The date column is currently stored as a character. To be able visualize the date variable as a continuous variable, we have to convert is. Therefore, R has a build in date class.  
**Task:** Just press *check*.

```{r "1__7"}
PaGP <- as.data.frame(PaGP)
PaGP$date <- as.Date(PaGP$date)
```

  
The data frame contains monthly numbers of generated MwH with coal and gas as well as prices of Energy commodities. 
Keep in mind that different commodities are traded in different units. Oil is traded in barrels (\$/bbl), coal in metric tons (\$/mt) and gas in British thermal units($/mmbtu). The natural gas index is set to 100 in the year 2010 and changes accordingly.
Prior to visualizing the data and to get clearer results, lets modifiy the data set. As mentioned before, commodities are traded in different units. Therefore we will add new entries for normalized prices, which gives us a good cost basis to produce the same amount of energy with each commodity.  On this account, we assume that `1 MwH = 0.454 mT Coal = 3.412 mmBtu Natural Gas`.

**Task:** Perform the above calculations. Just press *check*.

  mutate(price_naturalgas_USA_normalized = price_naturalgas_USA * 3.412,
         price_naturalgas_Europe_normalized = price_naturalgas_Europe * 3.412,
         price_coal_australia_normalized = price_coal_australia * 0.453, 
         price_coal_africa_normalized = price_coal_africa * 0.453)
```

**Task:** Output a graphic. Just press *check*.
```{r "1__9"}
ggplot(data=PaGP, aes(x=date)) +
  geom_line(aes(y=PaGP$price_coal_australia_normalized, color="Coal Autralia"), size=1) +

## Exercise 3 -- Road to a working model

In this chapter we will develop a model, which tries to find a connection between our given variables and CO2 emission. We will start from a simple linear approach and find our ways to a more complex but also more accurate model. We do not just stick to the

## Exercise 3.1 -- Finding the right model

**Task:** To load the data set `main_data.csv`, press `edit` and `check` afterwards.

```{r "3_1"}
data <- suppressMessages(read_csv("Data/main_data.csv"))
```

As we have seen in the previous exercise, the data heavily differ in the different `intersections`. 

As we have seen in the previous exercise it makes sense to calculate our model for each intersection separately. For this purpose we filter our data for intersection `EAST` and develop the model based on that. Afterwards we will use the model on each intersection.
Since we observe substantial variation in coal and gas prices, we additionally add a new variable for relative costs `CR` (`Cost Ratio`), which is defined as below:

$CR=\frac{C_{coal}}{C_{gas}}=\frac{P_{coal}+CO_{2,coal}\cdot P_{co2}}{P_{gas}+CO_{2,gas}\cdot P_{co2}}$

There are several ways to propose cost ratios, we will use the ratio between the price of coal and gas. 

**Task:** The data set contains a column `intercn` with values `EAST`, `WEST` and `ERCOT`. Filter only for data with `interconnection "EAST"` and store the new data frame in variable `east`. Additionally, calculate the cost ratio between `coal_price` and `gasprice`.
```{r "3_1__2"}
# ... <- data %>% 
#  select(date, intercn, CO2MASS, coal_price, gasprice, meant, load, nonFossil) %>% 
#  mutate(CR = .../..., CO2MASS=CO2MASS/1000000) %>% 
#  filter(intercn=="...")
east <- data %>% 
  select(date, intercn, CO2MASS, coal_price, gasprice, meant, load, nonFossil, so2price, netNSflow) %>% 
  mutate(CR = coal_price/gasprice, CO2MASS=CO2MASS/1000000) %>%
  filter(intercn=="EAST")
```

We will use the `stargazer()` function from the `stargazer` package to show summary statistics from our regressions. We don't need everything to know everything the basic functions displays, therefore we define a own custom function with statistics we need. Read below to find out more about `stargazer` and `custom functions` and continue with the next `task`.

### Stage 3: Multivariate Regression Model

In previous stages we came to the conclusion that a model that relies purely on `$CO_{2}$ emissions` and the `Cost Ratio` of gas and coal isn't sufficient to explain the real-life situation. In this `Stage` we will extend the model and add several `independent variables`.  
The model is a `reduced-form regression` and is defined as followed:

$CO_{2t}=s(CR_{t}|\beta)+s(load_{t}|\theta) + s(temp_t|\omega)+X_t\psi+\epsilon_t$
