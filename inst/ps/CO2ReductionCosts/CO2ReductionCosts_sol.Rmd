Welcome to this `Interactive Problem Set`. Within this problem set we will estimate the effects of carbon pricing on $CO_2$ emissions in the U.S. electricity sector, which account for about 27% of the total greenhouse gases (EPA 2020). The analysis is based on *"Inferring Carbon Abatement Costs in Electricity Markets: A Revealed Preference Approach using the Shale Revolution"* by Joseph A. Cullen, Erin T. Mansur (2016) - further referred as Cullen. You can download the paper and further resources to replicate the analysis from: <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/pol.20150388"> https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/pol.20150388</a>.

Cullen and Mansur found that carbon pricing can indeed reduce $CO_2$ emissions. They defined a model which uses the variation in natural gas prices caused by the shale-revolution to estimate the short-term effect on emissions. Carbon prices of around \$20 per ton of carbon dioxide can reduce emission by roughly 5%. By introducing a price of $70 per ton they observed a reduction of roughly 10%.

We will use the statistical programming language `R` to replicate the analysis proposed by Cullen. This problem set is intended to be interactive and you may occasionally need to write your own code. Therefore, you are required to have at least basic knowledge of statistics and R, but central concepts and functions will be explained along the way. If you are completely new to programming in R you can find a useful beginners guide [here](https://cran.r-project.org/manuals.html). The following is an overview of the upcoming content and instructions for interacting with the tasks.

### Outline

In *Exercise 1*, you are introduced to the U.S. energy market. We examine time-series data of fuel prices as well as generated electricity and show differences to the European energy market. In *Exercise 2*, we introduce the theory of mapping carbon prices. In *Chapter 3*, we derive a mathematical model over the course of several steps, which explains the relation of fuel costs and $CO_2$ emissions. We will start by suggesting simple linear models and work our way towards more complex approaches. In *Chapter 4*, we trace out the emission response curves to changing fuel costs. Afterwards we will transform these fuel costs into carbon prices and interpret the results. At last, we will discuss and conclude our results in *Exercise 5*.

  
### Instructions

The problem set is divided into exercises, which offer different ways of interaction. Interactions provide you with additional information, test your knowledge or require you to write your own code snippets. You are not required to solve the exercises in the given order, but since they build on each other it is recommended. Below you can find the different types of interactions with their corresponding function:

## Exercise 1 -- Insights into Energy Markets

The world has to further reduce its $CO_2$ emissions in order to meet the requirements of the Paris Convention on Climate Neutrality by 2050 (IPCC, 2014 & 2018). Energy consumption keeps rising daily and even though new technologies are being developed to increase the share of `green` electricity, we are still heavily dependent on `fossil fuels`. `Coal` is hereby one of the most important sources of energy, but at the same time the biggest cause of carbon dioxide emissions. Due to climate change and the fact that coal supplies would last for centuries (IEA, 2020), we have to find ways to reduce its use and therefore emissions. One solution is to further improve the efficiency of coal-generators, another one is to replace it with other fuel types.  
One of those alternative energy sources is `natural gas`, which is also a type of fossil fuel, but its $CO_2$ emissions and heat density is far more efficient. Nevertheless, natural gas wasn't considered to be a real alternative to coal for a long time because of higher extraction costs and more difficult handling.  
This changed with the `Shale Revolution`, which started in the early 2000s in the United States (Andreas, 2015) and eventually led to a higher supply of natural gas, lower prices and overall a substantial economic benefit for the United States (Hausmann et. al., 2015). Lanfrancois (2012) estimated, that based on the `Clean Power Plan` introduced by the Obama Administration in 2015, $CO_2$ emissions from the electricity sector could be reduced by roughly 23 to 42 percent by replacing existing coal to gas fired generators.  
  
#< info "Shale-Revolution"
Shale gas is a form of natural gas and is extracted from shale formation, a technology known as fracking. Since the start of this century, shale gas became an increasingly more popular form of natural gas in the United States. Whereas in the year 2000 shale gas only provided 1% of extracted natural gas in the U.S., nowadays it makes up roughly 50%. However, the long-term effects on the environment are highly uncertain and heavily debated (Howarth, 2019).  

You can find further information here:

#>
  
In `Exercise 1` you will get insights into global energy markets and explore time-series data of historic prices and generated electricity.

**Task:**
Use the `read_csv` function to load the data set `exercise1.csv` and store it in a variable called `dat`. `Read_csv` reports the variable type of each column after execution. This will come handy later on in this exercise. In future exercises we will disable this message.  

#< info "read_csv() and write_csv()"
The command `read_csv()` reads in a *csv file* and stores it into a given variable. Csv is a format for data files, which uses commas as separators and periods as decimals. Another version for data is *csv2*, where semicolons are used for separators and commas for decimals. We will strictly use csv files in this problem set.

Run the command below to import a data file which is in the same working directory. You can set and view your working directory with `setwd()` and `getwd()` accordingly.

```{r "1",eval=FALSE}
example <- read_csv("example.csv")
```

For files that are "above" your current working directory, you have to provide the full path to the file:

```{r "1__2",eval=FALSE}
example <- read_csv("C:/Data/example.csv")
```

For files that are located "below" the working directory it is sufficient to specify the file path starting with your current working directory:

```{r "1__3",eval=FALSE}
example <- read_csv("./Data/example.csv")
```

You can save data frames as csv files with `write_csv`:

```{r "1__4",eval=FALSE}
write_csv(example, path="example.csv")
```

For further information, use `help()`.
#>

```{r "1__5"}
#< fill_in
___ <- ___("./Data/exercise1.csv")
#>
# Sample solution
dat <- read_csv("./Data/exercise1.csv")
#< hint
display("Replace the variable name with the one given in the exercise description. No other changes are needed.")
#>
```

**Task:** First, we want to get an impression on the structure of our data set. Use `head(data frame, rows)` to display the first *6* rows of the data set `dat`. Without the second argument, returns the first 5 rows on default. Alternatively, you can click on `data` and get redirected to the `Data Explorer` tab, where you can navigate around the data frame and see some basic statistics.

```{r "1__6"}
#< fill_in
head(dat,___)
#>
# Sample solution
head(dat, 6)
#< hint
display("The second input parameter defines the number of row that are shown. Replace ___ with the number from the task description.")
#>
```

The data frame includes 214 observations of *monthly* data from the year 2002 to 2019. It contains data of generated power in MWh as well as prices of natural gas in Europe and the United States. Keep in mind that different commodities are traded in different units, coal in metric tons (`$/mt`) and gas in million British thermal units (`$/MMBtu`). I mentioned before that it would come handy to know the data types of our columns, hovering over the column names in the output above will give you the same information. R requires `dates` to be stored as type `Date` to be able to create plots along a timeframe. Since the date column is currently stored as type `character` we have to convert the variable into the correct format by using `as.Date()`.

**Task:** Convert the data type of column `date` to the correct type and store it under the same name.
```{r "1__7"}
#< fill_in
___ <- ___(___, format="%m/%d/%Y")
#>
# Sample solution
dat$date <- as.Date(dat$date, format="%m/%d/%Y")
#< hint
display("Convert the column \"dat$date\" into a date format using as.Date().")
#>
```

Now that we imported our data set and processed it for analysis, we can start exploring. First, we create a plot that tells us more about the price development of gas in both regions. Because of the fact that the Shale-Revolution started in the beginning of this century, we expect an increasing supply and therefore falling prices of natural gas in the United States. Prices in the European market should somehow differ.  
We are able to import a variety of custom packages that extend the basic functionality of R. For visualizations we will use `ggplot2`, which is widely considered to be one of the most powerful packages to create plots, having the downside that the handling can be a bit tricky. Therefore, you aren't required to create entire plots on your own but fill in gaps in the code. This way you get to know the package and at the same time will not be frustrated if your output doesn't meet the exact requirements.  
  
**Task:** Use the data frame `dat` to plot historic prices of natural gas in Europe and the United States along `date` on the x-Axis.

#< info "ggplot2"
`Ggplot2` is a powerful data visualization package for R, which is part of the `tidyverse` environment. Besides basic functions that are also provided by native R, it allows us to create highly customizable graphs by *altering*, *adding* or *removing* elements.

You are not required to have detailed knowledge about this package. However, you can find further information [here](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) or type `help(ggplot2)`.
#>
```{r "1__8",fig.width=8, fig.height=5}
#< fill_in
ggplot(data=___, aes(x=___)) +
  geom_line(aes(y=dat$price_naturalgas_USA, color="United States"), size=0.8) +
  geom_line(aes(y=dat$price_naturalgas_Europe, color="Europe"), size=0.8) +
  labs(x = "Year", y = "", title = "Natural Gas Prices", subtitle = "Y=$/MMBtu")+
  scale_color_manual(name="Region",values = c("blue","red"))
#>
# Sample solution
ggplot(data=dat, aes(x=date)) +
  geom_line(aes(y=dat$price_naturalgas_USA, color="United States"), size=0.8) +
  geom_line(aes(y=dat$price_naturalgas_Europe, color="Europe"), size=0.8) +
  labs(x = "Year", y = "", title = "Natural Gas Prices", subtitle = "Y=$/MMBtu") +
  scale_color_manual(name="Region",values = c("blue","red"))
```

The output confirms our assumptions. The price spikes in 2005 and 2008 are mostly consequences of the Iraq War and the Financial Crisis. Apart from that we observe decreasing gas prices in the U.S. from just over $12 in 2008 to under \$2 in 2016 and since then prices fluctuated around roughly the same level.  
Natural gas prices in Europe remained at a significantly higher level. Fracking isn't as popular in Europe and a major share of gas gets imported from Russia, which drives up prices. Additionally, Europe has a different energy mix in comparison to the United States. According to the European Environment Agency (EEA, 2019), the consumption of gas in Europe decreased in average by 2.9% per year since 2005, whereas in the U.S. natural gas reached new all-time highs almost every year.  
Besides fuel prices our data frame also contains data of generated power in the United States. Before we look at these data, take your first quiz:  

#< quiz "Proportion of Sectors"
question: Did the proportion of gas-generated electricity increase or decrease over time in comparison to coal-generated electricity?

sc:
    - increased*
    - decreased
success: Great, your answer is correct!
failure: Try again.
#>  
&nbsp;

**Task:** Create a new plot for generated electricity. Plot `date` on the x-Axis and the generated electricity on the y-Axis. Draw separate lines for `gas-generated power` as well as `coal-generated power`, which are added with `geom_line`. You can take the code from the previous graph as reference or conduct the `help()` function.

```{r "1__9",fig.width=8, fig.height=5}
#< fill_in
ggplot(data=___, aes(x=___)) +
  ___(aes(___=dat$generated_coal, color="Coal Generation (TWh)"), size=0.8, alpha=0.5) +
  ___(aes(___=dat$generated_gas, color="Natural Gas Generation (TWh)"), size=0.8, alpha=0.5) +
  labs(x = "Year", y = "", title = "Monthly Generation by Fueltype", subtitle = "Y=Monthly Electricty (TWh)")+
  scale_color_manual(name="",values = c("black","red"))+
  scale_y_continuous(breaks=seq(0,200,25))
#>
# Sample solution
ggplot(data=dat, aes(x=date)) +
  geom_line(aes(y=dat$generated_coal, color="Coal Generation (TWh)"), size=0.8, alpha=0.5) +
  geom_line(aes(y=dat$generated_gas, color="Natural Gas Generation (TWh)"), size=0.8, alpha=0.5) +
  labs(x = "Year", y = "", title = "Monthly Generation by Fueltype", subtitle = "Y=Monthly Electricty (TWh)")+
  scale_color_manual(name="",values = c("black","red"))+
  scale_y_continuous(breaks=seq(0,200,25))
```

The results are in line with what we should expect. With a higher supply of gas and decreasing prices, gas generators increased their share in power generation over time. Giving you a bit more background: Coal-fired generators tend to have lower operating costs than gas-fired ones but are expensive to start and adjust slowly to fluctuating demands. Gas-generators can fill these gaps. The first of two different types of gas generators are `Peaker Plants`. They run in high demand hours due to their fast start-up times but suffer from high marginal costs. The second type are `Combined Cycle Gas Turbines` (CCGT), which have low heat rates (high efficiency of turning fuel into power) and are used to provide baseline power generation throughout the day.  
Combining these factors, both fuel-generators have the possibility to generate power in all situations and can meet the general demands of electricity, which means that the fuels are *switchable*. However, the mechanism of `fuel switching` is a lot more complex than just about the cost efficiency. The capacity of plants, transmission grid limits (Mansur & White 2012, Davis & Hausman 2015) or market power of firms (Bushnell, Mansur & Saravia 2008) also play a big role.  
Additionally, we observe severe fluctuations of generated power along the year that occur with smaller peaks in summer and bigger ones in the winter seasons. These variations in demand are largely driven by using air conditioning in summer and space heating in winter (EIA, 2020/3).

## Exercise 2 -- Mapping Carbon Pricing

### Relationship between Fuel and Carbon Prices

In this exercise we introduce the theory which connects the mechanism of `fuel switching` to our analysis. We already mentioned that there are several factors that influence the usage of coal and gas generators. We will include some of them later in our analysis, but for now we keep it simple and only consider costs.  
In that case, `Marginal Costs` would be the central factor in making this decision. Per definition, marginal costs not only include the price of fuel, but all costs that are incurred in producing additional units of electricity.  
Cullen defined a formula which expresses `marginal costs` as an equation of `heat rate` and the `costs of burning fuel`. Variable names of this exercise are explained in the info-box below:

#< info "Variable names"
$MC$: Marginal Costs  
$HR$: Heat Rate, MMBtu/MWh  
$C_{fuel}$: Cost of burning fuel  
$P_{fuel}$: Fuel Price, $/MMBtu  
$CO_{2,fuel}$: Carbon content of fuel, tons/MMBtu  
$P_{co2}$: Carbon Price , $/ton
#>

$$\tag{1}MC=HR\cdot(P_{fuel}+CO_{2,fuel}\cdot P_{co2})=HR\cdot C_{fuel}$$

Long-term we want to increase the share of green-power generation. Short term we have to give the market incentives to use the available capacities of generators as effectively as possible to minimize emissions. Coal contains approximately twice as much carbon as natural gas (EIA, 2019), which leads to higher emissions for coal generators per generated unit of electricity. We can use this property and introduce *carbon pricing*. According to `Equation 1` this leads to steeper marginal costs for coal-generators and therefore to a reduced usage of coal in favor of gas (assuming the capacities to interchange generators are available). This should force the industry towards our short-term goal as well enhance the transition to green-power generation over a longer timeframe.  
However, we will not observe carbon prices in our data, but a wide variation of fuel costs (as seen in the previous exercise). We can explain the relative costs of both fuel types by creating a coal-gas ratio:

$$\tag{2}costratio=\frac{C_{coal}}{C_{gas}}$$

By combining Equation `1` and `2`, we can explain `cost ratios` as a function of `fuel costs`, `carbon content` and `carbon prices`:  

$$\tag{3}costratio=\frac{C_{coal}}{C_{gas}}=\frac{P_{coal}+CO_{2,coal}\cdot P_{co2}}{P_{gas}+CO_{2,gas}\cdot P_{co2}}$$

To evaluate the impacts of carbon pricing on the U.S. energy market we have to estimate the response of $CO_2$ emissions to `carbon prices`. You may ask yourself why we build equations that are mainly focused on fuel costs. As mentioned, we won't observe any carbon prices in our data, but a wide range of fuel costs, which we can use to calculate cost ratios at various levels of emissions. Carbon prices hereby directly affect the marginal costs of our fuel types by adding to the costs and therefore also affect the cost ratios (see `Equation 3`).  
In the following section we will explore how changes of fuel costs, cost ratios and carbon prices interact. First, we agree on base-level prices for both fuel types to interpret the changes in absolute numbers. Ideally, we want to set a base-level based on future price predictions. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (`EIA`) provides predictions for the year 2025:  

- Average delivered coal price `$2.25/MMBtu` 
- Average delivered gas prices `$5.75/MMBtu`
  
#< quiz "Cost Ratios"
question: According to Equation 3, what happens to our cost ratio if natural gas doubles in costs and coal costs decrease by 25%.
sc:
    - Rise
    - Equal
    - Fall*
success: Great, your answer is correct!
failure: Try again.
#>  
&nbsp;

This relation is obviously quite intuitive. By adding carbon prices as seen in `Equation 3`, it gets a bit more complex. This is visualized in the graph below. The values of fuel costs correspond to the base prices mentioned above.  

<img src="./Material/relationship.png" alt="drawing" width="600"/>
Source: Cullen 
  
Panel `(a)` shows the relationship between fixed costs of `coal` and `gas` when `carbon prices` get introduced (dashed lines). As explained, this leads to steeper marginal costs for coal and at a certain level, natural gas becomes more cost efficient. Panel `(c)` displays the results when transforming fuel costs in cost ratios as defined in `Equation 2`. This transformation has the advantage that we can reduce the relation of fuel costs into one variable which makes the interpretation of our results much easier.  
Panel `(b)` and `(d)` plot the same relation, but this time in absence of carbon prices and with fixed coal prices. The message you should take away is, that we can find the same cost ratios (`red lines`) with both approaches, either by adding carbon prices or holding coal prices fixed. This fact enables us to set up our analysis without having data of carbon prices, but various data of fuel costs.

#< quiz "carbon Prices" 

question: Carbon pricing changes the relative costs of coal and gas in an identical manner.
sc:
    - True*
    - False
success: Great, your answer is correct!
failure: Try again.
#>  
&nbsp;

In summary, we want to use the variation in cost ratios to predict the effects of changing fuel costs (and later carbon prices) on $CO_2$ emissions. We will start working towards such a mathematical model in the next chapter. Click `Go to next exercise`.

## Exercise 3.1 -- Emission Response Curves - A simple Approach

A short recapture: Up to this point we got insights into the U.S. energy market and introduced the concept of mapping carbon prices. In this exercise we will begin to develop a model which explains the effects of changing fuel costs on emissions. We start by proposing a simple linear relationship and work our way to more complex but also more precise models.  
If you are purely interested in the final model and the economic impact, you can skip to `Exercise 4.1`. The next two exercises will focus on regression theory, which builds the basis to understand our methods we use in the main analysis.  

**Task:** To get started, load the data set `exercise3.csv`, press `edit` and `check` afterwards.
```{r "3_1",message=FALSE}
#< task_notest
data <- read_csv("Data/exercise3.csv")
head(data,3)
#>
```

The data set consists of 2557 observations of U.S. emission data with corresponding prices and generated electricity from 2006 onwards. This is a preprocessed data file; we only provide the original data sources. Along the way we will expand these data and provide additional information. Below you find the meaning of each variable and its associated unit:  

`co2mass`: $CO_2$ Emissions in tons  
`gasprice`: Capacity weighted average daily gas costs ($ per million BTU)  
`coalprice`: Costs of Coal ($ per million BTU)  
`load`: Daily electricity consumption in MWh  

The data are gathered from several official U.S. agencies, `Emission` data are measured by the Continuous Emissions Monitoring System (CEMS) of the `Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)`. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) collects data of `coal prices` in Form 923. Spot prices for `gas` can be found at the `Intercontinental Exchange (ICE)` and data for `electricity consumption` or `load` are provided by the `Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC)` in Form 714.  

**Task:** Combine the following operations by using the pipe operator `%>%`: Calculate the cost ratios of `coalprice` and `gasprice` according to `Equation 2`. For an easier interpretation we convert emissions and load from tons to millions of tons. Store the output in `dat`.

#< info "Pipe, Select(), Filter(), Mutate()"
The pipe operator `%>%` is a feature of the `dplyr` package. Essentially it allows us to execute multiple operation on a data frame at once. Each pipe operator returns a data frame and passes it to the next connected function.  
`Select()` filters for certain columns of data, whereas `filter()` does the same for rows.  
If you want to create new or alter existing columns, you can use `mutate()`. There are several more functions to alter your data frames, you can find a cheat sheet [here](https://rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/data-wrangling-cheatsheet.pdf).
  
```{r "3_1__2",eval=FALSE}
example %>% 
  select(1:5) %>%  # keep columns from index 1 to 5  
  filter(columnname == "value") # filter for argument  
  mutate(new_column = old_column+1) %>% # create or alter columns
```
#>

```{r "3_1__3"}
#< fill_in
___ <- data ___ 
  mutate(costratio = ___/___,
         co2mass = co2mass/1000000),
         load = load/1000000)
#>
# Sample solution
dat <- data %>% 
  mutate(costratio = coalprice/gasprice,
         co2mass = co2mass/1000000,
         load = load/1000000)
#< hint
display("Fill in the gaps with variable names given in the exercise description. Don't forget the pipes.")
#>
```


### Linear Regression

The easiest way to build a model is to propose a simple linear regression that predicts emissions purely based on a linear relationship to cost ratios. In mathematical terms we can express the relationship as followed, with $co2mass_{2}$ for mass of $CO_2$ emissions, $\beta_t$ for our coeffcients and $\epsilon_t$ for the error-term:

$$co2mass_{t}=\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}\cdot costratio_{t}+\epsilon_t$$

#< info "Linear Regression with lm()"

`Lm()` is part of the `stats` package, which is loaded on default. As shown in the syntax example below, it enables us to regress `y` on the independent variables `x1` and `x2`. The model itself is handled just like every other variable, which can either be stored or used in other functions. Another popular function to solve linear regressions in R is `felm()`, which provides further functionality e.g. for including `fixed effects`.

```{r "3_1__4",eval=FALSE}
example <- lm(y~x1+x2, data=dat)
```

You can find more information [here](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/stats/versions/3.6.2/topics/lm) or use the `help()` function.
#>

**Task:** Run a regression with `co2mass` as the dependent variable and `costratio` as the independent variable. Use `dat` for the data argument and store it in the variable `fit`. 
```{r "3_1__5"}
#< task
#>
fit <- lm(co2mass ~ costratio, data=dat)
```

We could use the default function `summary()` to display the summary statistics of our first regression. Since its output is pretty static we will use `stargazer()` instead. It allows us to customize the output to our needs and it supports `HTML` format as well. Therefore, we define our own version of stargazer() and at the same time introduce custom functions which will be useful later on. Read the `Info Boxes` below to find out more.  

**Task:** Just press *check*.

#< info "Stargazer"
`stargazer` provides specialized `HTML` formatting for regression tables and summary statistics. It is easy to use, supports a large number of model types and formats data in a more pleasing way. For further information type `help(stargazer)` or click [here](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/stargazer/).
#>

#< info "Custom functions"
R provides an easy framework to add our own functions. The syntax is comparable to other programming languages you could be familiar with. Below you find the basic structure and an example:

```{r "3_1__6",eval=FALSE}
myfunction <- function(arg1, arg2, ... ){  
  statements  
  return(object)
}
```  
Here's a simple function that adds `5` to the input:
```{r "3_1__7",eval=FALSE}
example <- function(x) {  
  x + 5
  return(x)
}  
example(1)
```  
You find more information [here](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/versions/3.6.2/topics/function).

```{r "3_1__8"}
#< task_notest
ShowRegression <- function(...){
  library(stargazer)
    stargazer(..., 
            type = "text", 
            style = "aer",  
            digits = 3,
            df = FALSE,
            star.cutoffs = c(0.05, 0.01, 0.001),
            model.names = FALSE,
            object.names = TRUE,
            model.numbers = FALSE, 
            omit.stat=c("f", "ser")
    )
}
#>
```

#< quiz "Reg1"
question: Before we look at the summary, how do increasing cost ratios effect emissions?

sc:
    - With increasing cost ratios emissions will increase.
    - With increasing cost ratios emissions will fall.*
success: Great, your answer is correct!
failure: Try again.
#>  
  
**Task:** Use the function we defined above to display the summary statistics of `fit`.
```{r "3_1__9"}
#< task
#>
# Sample solution
ShowRegression(fit)
```

We observe a positive intercept term $\beta_0$ with 5.877 and a negative coefficient for $\beta_1$ of -1.306, meaning that emissions fall with increasing cost ratios. The three stars next to our coefficient indicate that our coefficient is significant at the 0.1% level. Therefore, we can say that costratio is a significant factor to explain emissions.

#< info "R-squared"
`R-Squared` is a statistical measurement that represents the correlation between `fitted values` and `observed values`. R-squared is always positive and ranges from 0 to 1. A value closer to 1 indicates, that the suggested model explains most of the variance in the outcome variable.  Mathematically we can describe this as followed: 
$$R^{2}=1-\frac{Unexplained\ Variation}{Total\ Variation}$$
Nevertheless, this indicator only works as intended for models with one independent variable. R-Squared should be adjusted for multivariate regression models because it naturally increases with a higher number of variables, even if these variables are only barely responsible for the predicted values. This is solved by using `Adjusted R-Squared`, which takes the number of variables into account.
#>

The output also tells us if our model fits the data. In our case we use the `Adjusted R-Squared` indicator, which measures quite low at $19.7%$. However, we should interpret this measurement with caution. As mentioned before, our coefficients are statistically significant, therefore we are still able to draw conclusions from our results as shown above. With that in mind there is much room of improvement in terms of the overall fit of our model which we will improve going further.


### Multivariate Regression Models

If we look back at the implications of the energy market from `Exercise 1`, we know that there are several other factors next to costs that should affect $CO_2$ emissions in the energy sector. To include additional effects in our model we can use `Multivariate Regression Models`. For now, we will add the effect of `electricity consumption` (`load`). The regression formula changes to:  

$$co2mass_{t}=\beta_0+\beta_1\cdot costratio_t+\beta_2\cdot load_t+\epsilon_t$$

**Task:** Run a regression based on the regression formula from above. Use the same data frame `dat` and store it as `fit1`. Additionally, use `ShowRegression()` to output the summary statistics of `fit` and `fit1`.
```{r "3_1__10"}
#< task
#>
# Sample solution
fit1 = lm(co2mass ~ costratio + load, data=dat)
ShowRegression(fit,fit1)
```

The effect of `costratio` on emissions is around half as large as before. `Load` has a positive coefficient $\beta_2$ of 0.774, which is intuitive since emissions should increase with more generated electricity. According to the p-values, all coefficients are significant, but we observe a big difference in the `R-squared` measurement. The adjusted R-squared indicator changes to 92.5% in comparison to 19.7% from our first model. We can conclude from this that the majority of the variance of our second model is explained by the load coefficient.
We see some improvement in our statistics when introducing a second coefficient to our model. As long as we keep our models that simple, we can directly draw conclusions from the summary statistics. However, if we continue to add more variables to our model and introduce other statistical methods this won't be that easy. Therefore, having a well fitted model is just the first step for us. Eventually we want to plot the response curves of emissions to changing fuel costs. To do this for any model, we first have to calculate the fitted values based on our regression model. R provides a function exactly for this case, called `predict()`.  

**Task:** Predict the fitted values of `fit1`, use the data `dat` and store it in `co2.hat1`.

#< info "Predict"
We can predict the corresponding fitted values of our model with the `predict()` function. As minimum arguments it takes the fitted model and a data frame in which the function look for variables to predict from:  

```{r "3_1__11",eval=FALSE}
fitted.values <- predict(model, data)
``` 
#>

```{r "3_1__12"}
#< fill_in
co2.hat1 = ___
#>
# Sample solution
co2.hat1 = predict(fit1, dat)
```

After calculating the fitted values of our regression model, we can proceed to plot our response curve. Because of the fact, that the second model is a multivariate regression with two independent variables, a corresponding plot would span over three dimensions. It is a valid solution to visualize our results that way, but we want to produce scientific robust results and therefore will plot our results in a two-dimensional graph. Since it is not that common to plot regression models, let's see what will happen if we continue and simply plot our fitted values for `fit1`. 

**Task:** Just press *check*
```{r "3_1__13"}
#< task_notest
ggplot(dat,aes(x=costratio,y=co2.hat1))+
        geom_line(aes(x=dat$costratio, y=co2.hat1))+
        labs(y="Emissions", x="Cost Ratio")
#>
```

`R` hereby connects all fitted values along the range of cost ratios. Since we don't consider the `load` variable in the two-dimensional graph, we produce an output that doesn't meet our expectations. To solve this issue, we will use a work-around in the way that we won't predict our fitted values on the original data frame that we used to build our model on. Instead we evaluate all independent variables with exception of cost ratios at their respective means. This is valid because the average of the fitted values $\hat{y_i}$ is equal to the average of the actual values $y_i$: 

$$\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n \hat{y_i}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n y_i$$

This is true for linear regressions with an intercept term (Sarndal, Swensson and Wretman, 1992). In this case, the sum of the residuals is equal to zero.  
To use this method for our analysis we create a new data frame with the means of our independent variables (except cost ratios). At this point we only added `load` to our model, therefore we include `costratio` and the mean value of `load`. Afterwards we use this data frame as argument in `predict()` and plot the results once more.

**Task:** Just press *check*.
```{r "3_1__14"}
#< task_notest
# create a new data frame
pred_dat <- tibble(co2mass = dat$co2mass, costratio = dat$costratio) %>%
  cbind(load=mean(dat$load))
# run predict() with the new data frame
co2.hat1 <- predict(fit1, pred_dat)
# plot the resulting regression curve
ggplot(pred_dat,aes(x=costratio,y=dat$co2mass))+
    geom_line(aes(x=costratio, y=co2.hat1))+
    labs(y="Emissions", x="Cost Ratio")
#>
```


### Non-linear Models

Now, that we know how to plot multivariate regression models into a two-dimensional grid, we can continue to improve our model. Our previous models assumed a linear relationship between emissions, fuel prices and load. Given the complexity of electricity markets and the statistics we gathered up to this point, we should assume a more complex relationship in form of a highly non-linear response of emissions. The type of regression that fits a non-linear relationship between dependent and independent variables is called `Polynomial Regression`. The easiest way to transform our previous model is to replace one linear coefficient with a cubic function:

$$co2mass_{t}=\beta_0+\beta_1\cdot costratio_t+\beta_2\cdot costratio_t^2+\beta_3\cdot costratio_t^3+\beta_4\cdot load_t+\epsilon_t$$

**Task:** The syntax in R to create a cubic function is `poly()`. It is sufficient to provide the highest degree of the polynomial function as R expands the formula on its own. Just press *check*.
```{r "3_1__15"}
#< task_notest
fit2 <- lm(co2mass ~ poly(costratio,3, raw = TRUE) + load, data=dat)
ShowRegression(fit1, fit2)
#>
```

The summary shows the statistics for the linear (`fit1`) and polynomial model (`fit2`). R provides a coefficient for every degree of the cubic function. The value of adjusted R-squared is comparable between both models, but as mentioned before we should not purely rely on this measurement. Since we stated that emissions should follow a highly non-linear response, we can assume that the non-linear model is a better fit.  
We conclude this exercise by plotting the response curve once again and compare our results. First, we predict the fitted values of our latest model and afterwards create our plot as shown before.

**Task:** Run `predict()` on `fit2` and use the data frame `pred_dat`.
```{r "3_1__16"}
#< fill_in
co2.hat2 <- ___
#>
# Sample solution
co2.hat2 <- predict(fit2, pred_dat)
```

**Task:** Create a new plot. Use `geom_line()` to plot one line each for `co2.hat1` and `co2.hat2`. Assign `costratio` to the x-axis and the fitted emission values to the y-axis.
```{r "3_1__17"}
#< fill_in
ggplot(pred_dat,aes(x=costratio,y=dat_east$co2mass))+
   geom_line(aes(___), color="red") +
   geom_line(aes(___), color="green") +
   scale_color_manual(name="",values = c("black","red"))+
   labs(x="Cost Ratio", y="Emissions")
#>
# Sample solution
ggplot(pred_dat,aes(x=costratio,y=dat_east$co2mass))+
    geom_line(aes(x=costratio, y=co2.hat1, color="linear")) +
    geom_line(aes(x=costratio, y=co2.hat2, color="non-linear")) +
    scale_color_manual(name="",values = c("black","red"))+
    labs(x="Cost Ratio", y="Emissions")
```

The plot shows us the two regression lines for the linear (`fit`) and non-linear regression (`fit1`). The non-linear model (red line) seems to reflect the real-world scenario a lot better. Due to technology and capacity limitations, it is unlikely that emissions increase linearly without constraints at the lower and upper end of our limits.  
Looking closely though, we still see some flaws that don't seem to be accurate. It is unrealistic that emissions increase again when cost ratios reach a certain level. This is caused by the mathematical property of this basic type of cubic functions. Moving forward we improve the use of polynomial function in our model.

## Exercise 3.2 -- Restricted Cubic Spline Regressions

In this exercise we will introduce the concepts of `Restricted Spline Regressions`, which are a special form of polynomial regressions. In the world of craftsmen' the term spline refers to a strip of wood that is being shaped into a smooth curve. The strip is hereby forced around fixed points to form a natural spline. In mathematics these splines are defined as a form of piece-wise polynomial functions, which usually consist of cubic polynomials. `Knots` refer to the fixed points in mathematical terms and are placed along the range of data. As we adjust the number of knots the spline becomes more or less flexible.  

<img src="./Material/spline.png" alt="drawing" width="400"/>
Source: Own Illustration  

We can roughly visualize this method with the graph above. Given a range of data, we set a certain number of `Knots` and we fit a cubic function in each `Segment`. Combining all cubic function will give us our regression line for the spline regression. We have to choose the number of knots with caution because a wrong amount can lead to over- or underfitting. We can visualize the fit by conducting robustness tests, which we will perform for our main results later on.  At last, our model will be `restricted`, meaning that the spline is constrained to be linear in front of the first and after the last knot. This solves the problem we observed with the polynomial model at the end of last exercise.

**Task:** To start, load the required data. We use the same data as in the last exercise and the data frame already includes the changes we made at the beginning. Just press *check*.
```{r "3_2",message=FALSE}
dat <- read_csv("Data/exercise3_2.csv")
```

**Task:** Fit a regression model, which includes `costratio` and `load` as natural splines with `5` degrees of freedom. Use the data frame `dat_east`. Just press *check*.  

$$co2mass_{t}=s(priceratio_{t}|\beta)+s(load_{t}|\theta)+\epsilon_t$$

#< info "ns()" 
`Ns()` is part of the `splines` package and allows us to perform natural splines regressions on our data. `Df` defines the degrees of freedom and chooses the knots accordingly, which are placed at predefined quantiles. In our case we will choose `df=5`, which places 5 knots at following quantiles: `[0.05, 0.275, 0.5, 0.725, 0.95]` (Harrell, 2001).  

A simple syntax example of cubic spline regression:  

```{r "3_2__2",eval=FALSE}
#build a model that tries to explain the relation between weight and color of bananas
fit <- lm(banana_weight ~ ns(banana_color, df=5), data=bananas)
```

For full documentation of the function, conduct the help() function.
#>

```{r "3_2__3",message=FALSE}
#< fill_in
model3 <- co2mass ~ ns(___)+ns(___)
fit3 <- lm(model3, data=dat)
#>
# Sample solution
model3 <- co2mass ~ ns(costratio,df = 5)+ns(load, df=5)
fit3 <- lm(model3, data=dat)
```

**Task:** Use `ShowRegression()` to get the summary statistics of `fit3`.
```{r "3_2__4"}
#< task
#>
# Sample solution
ShowRegression(fit3)
```

The summary statistic of the spline model is comparable to the polynomial regression from the previous exercise, where we got a coefficient for each degree of the cubic function. In this case we got a coefficient for every degree of freedom. Since splines are transformations of explanatory variables it is not possible to interpret these coefficients straightaway. Nevertheless, we want to get clear and interpretable results and that is the reason we introduced the methods to plot our models.  

**Task:** Just press *check*.
```{r "3_2__5",warning=FALSE}
#< task_notest
# create data frame with mean values
pred_dat <- tibble(costratio = dat$costratio) %>%
  cbind(load=mean(dat$load))
# predict fitted values
co2.hat3 <- predict(fit3, pred_dat)
# plot results
ggplot(pred_dat,aes(x=costratio,y=dat$co2mass))+
    geom_point(alpha=0.3) + 
    geom_line(aes(x=costratio, y=co2.hat3), color="red") + 
    scale_y_continuous(limits=c(4,6)) +
    labs(x="Cost Ratio", y="Emissions")
#>
```

We continue to see a negative relationship between cost ratios and $CO_2$ emissions. Additionally, I added the data points of $CO_2$ emissions. As cost ratios increase, the variance between our regression line and the observations tend to increase. This is a strong indicator that our model suffers from heteroskedasticity. Since standard error rely on the assumption that there's no correlation between the independent variables and the variance of the dependent variables, we should calculate `heteroskedasticity robust standard errors` here instead.  
I defined a custom function which takes our model, the original data and the data frame for our prediction as arguments and returns a data frame with the fitted values and the $95\%$ confidence intervals (CI). The function combines the steps of running the regression, predicting fitted values and calculated the CI's. It uses `lm_robust()` from the `estimatr` package to run the regression and calculate the robust errors, which is a deviation of the default `lm()` function. For reference, see the function in the info box below, afterwards run the code below to see the output.

**TASK** Just press *check*.

#< info "Confidence interval" 
Confidence intervals are estimates that are calculated based on the observed data. Mathematically, given we observe values $x_1...x_n$ and a confidence level of $95\%$, the confidence interval has a probability $95\%$ to contain the true underlying parameters.

#< info "Custom predict function" 
```{r "3_2__6",eval=FALSE, optional=TRUE}
PredictRobust <- function(m, data, data_p) {

  # predict fitted values based on our robust model and add CI's

# plot fit with robust confidence intervals

    # geom_ribbon() fills the are between the min and max values
    geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = co2.hat3$lwr, ymax = co2.hat3$upr), color="lightgrey", fill="lightgrey", alpha=0.5) +
    geom_line(aes(x=pred_dat$costratio, y=co2.hat3$fit), color="black")+
    labs(x="Cost Ratio", y="Emissions")

## Exercise 4 -- Examining Carbon Abatement

In the following chapter we shift our focus away from theory and work towards our final results. To approach our main analysis, we split it into two parts:

- First (`Exercise 4.1`), we expand our model and determine the $CO_2$ emission response curve to changing fuel costs. The model makes use of the methods we introduced before and adds additional variables to reflect the behavior of the U.S. energy market as closely as possible.  

- Afterwards (`Exercise 4.2`), we will transform our fuel costs into carbon prices, calculate the true costs of emission reductions and discuss the results.  

In Chapter 3 we worked our way towards a fitting model and ended up with a specific form of spline regressions. To keep it simple we limited our data to fuel costs and generated electricity (`load`). In this exercise we will introduce additional factors we want to include in our model and get a final impression of our data. 

**Task:** Load the data set `exercise4.csv` with `read_csv` and store it into a variable called `dat`.

```{r "4",message=FALSE}
#< fill_in
___ <- ___("./Data/___")
head(dat, 3)

# Sample solution
dat <- read_csv("./Data/exercise4.csv")
head(dat, 3)
```

#< info "Interconnections" 

<img src="./Material/interconnections.png" alt="drawing" width="400"/>
Source: Cullen

The U.S. electric grid is made up of three major `Interconnections`, that in turn consist of different balancing authorities and are responsible for maintaining the electricity balance within the region. Local electricity grids form a network to provide higher stability and reliability.  
Interconnections operate mostly independent from each other and exchange little to no electricity. This is a huge difference in comparison to the European electricity grid, where grid stability is ensured across borders.

- `Eastern Interconnection (EAST)`: Consists of 36 balancing authorities and reaches from the East Coast to the Rocky Mountains.
- `Western Interconnection (WECC)`: Involves 37 balancing authorities, which are located in the West of North America.
- `Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT)`: Consists of large parts of Texas

#>

The data frame combines data of previous chapters with additional factors such as non-fossil power generation, temperature data and $SO_2$ permit prices. The first thing we notice is that the data are now separated by interconnection (see `Info Box` above). Up to this point we exclusively worked with the data of the Eastern Interconnection. Below you find information of the newly added variables, the remaining structure of the data frame is the same:  

`tlsd`, `tlmin`, `tlmax`: Standard deviation, minimum and maximum of `load`  
`meant`: Average daily temperature  
`nonFossil`: Electricity generated with non-fossil fuel in MWh  
`so2price`: Permit prices of $SO_2$ ($/ton)  
`netNSflow`: Electricity imports from Canada to the U.S. in MWh  

The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) provides data for `non-fossil` energy production, permit prices for $SO_2$ are collected from the `EPA Clean Air Markets` and `net imports` of electricity from Canada are gathered from the `National Energy Board of Canada`. You can find links to the resources in the `References` section.  
Another factor we have not considered yet is the seasonal component in energy consumption. We saw in `Exercise 1`, that load varies heavily along the year with smaller peaks in summer and bigger peaks in winter. To adjust for this effect, we create a dummy variable that controls for years and seasons (off-season/summer/winter). 

**Task:** Calculate the seasonal dummy variable and show the first few rows. Just press *check*.
```{r "4__2"}
#< task_notest
dat_final <- dat %>% 
  mutate(season=(month>3) + (month>6) + (month>9),
         yearseason=year*10+season)

head(dat_final,3)
#>
```

This data frame inherits all variables we will include in our main results. With that in mind, we create a summary table which will give us a final impression of important key values.  

**Task:** Use `group_by()` to group the data frame `dat` by `intercn` and `summarise_all()` to calculate the means of every column. For formatting we use `kable()`. Just press *check*.

#< info "group_by() and summarise()"
`Group_by()` allows us to group a data frame by specific variables. Operations on grouped data are performed on each group.  

The function `summarise()` is one of those operations and performs calculations such as means (`mean()`) or finding minimums (`min()`). There are several pre-implemented version of summarise() functions in R. The one we use here is `summarise_all()`, which runs the operations on all columns.

To give you an example, let us pretend we have a data frame `data` with several `car manufacturer`, their respective car models with `prices` and we want to calculate the average car price per manufacturer:

```{r "4__3",eval=FALSE}
example <- data %>% 
  group_by(manufacturer) %>%
  summarise(mean_price = mean(price))
```

If you need more information, call `help(group_by)` or `help(summarize)`.
#>
  
#< info "kable()"
The package `kableExtra` and in particular the function `kable()` provides us with a framework to build complex *LaTeX* tables and enables us to manipulate the table styling by adding HTML/CSS elements. It supports the pipe function `%>%` and works quite similar to `ggplot` by allowing us to add layers to our tables.

You can find detailed information on the functionalities [here](http://haozhu233.github.io/kableExtra/awesome_table_in_pdf.pdf).
#>

```{r "4__4"}
#< task_notest
dat_final %>% 
    select(intercn, co2mass, load, coalprice, gasprice, costratio, nonfossil) %>% 
    group_by(intercn) %>% 
    mutate(co2mass = co2mass/1000, load=load/1000, "Emission Rate"=co2mass/load, nonfossil=nonfossil/100000) %>% 
    summarise_all("mean") %>% 
    kable(format="html", align="c", col.names = c("intercn","Emissions","Load","Gas Cost","Coal Cost","Cost Ratio","Non Fossil","Emission Rate")) %>%
    kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed"), position = "center", full_width = F)
#>
```

The table reports the means of important measurement for each interconnection. We clearly see that `EAST` is by far the biggest of the observed energy markets in terms of emissions, load and non-fossil power generation. The emissions seem to increase proportionally to the electricity consumption for all interconnections if we consider the electricity production from non-fossil sources. This gets clearer if the look at the emission rates, which are defined as emissions over load. The `Western` Interconnection has by far the `greenest` energy production of all regions, followed with some distance by the Texas (`ERCOT`) and `Eastern` Interconnection. Furthermore, we observe clear variations in cost ratios.  
Initially we developed our model on the data of the Eastern Interconnections. To summarize the results from the table, we observe vastly different market conditions in each region. Because of that we cannot run our model on the entire market but instead will perform our analysis on each interconnection separately. This way we make sure to get statistically robust results for each region and we can identify differences across markets.

## Exercise 4.1 -- Estimated CO2 Response to Fuel Prices

In the first step we will perform the regression based on the final data frame from last exercise and our methods from `Exercise 3.2`. Afterwards we will use this model to predict $CO_2$ emissions and trace out the emission response curve to changing fuel costs. We will carry out the analysis step by step for interconnection `EAST`, afterwards apply it to `ERCOT` and `WECC` and interpret our results.  
As a side note, we will dive through a bunch of code. It is not meant to be the shortest or the most efficient but should allow you to follow each step closely.  
  
The first code chunks import our data and filter for interconnection `EAST`. Afterwards, we create a new data frame with the mean values as shown in `Exercise 3.1`. These steps are straight forward, go ahead and prepare our data.

**Task:** Load the data frame and store it in `dat`. Just press *check*.
```{r "4_1",message=FALSE}
#< task_notest
dat <- read_csv("Data/exercise4_1.csv")
head(dat,3)
#>
```

**Task:** Filter the data set `dat` for intercn `EAST` and store it in `east`.
```{r "4_1__2"}
#< task
#>
east <- filter(dat, intercn=="EAST")
#< hint
display("Filter() takes a data frame as first argument and a logic as second. We want to filter for intercn \"EAST\".")
#>
```

**Task:** Calculate the `mean` of the given variables. First, `select()` the necessary columns and then use `summarise_all()` to calculate the means. Store the result in `mean_east`.
```{r "4_1__3"}
#< fill_in
___ <- east %>% 
  select(load, tlsd, tlmin, tlmax, meant, nonfossil, so2price, netNSflow, yearseason) %>% 
  ___
#>
# Sample solution
mean_east <- east %>% 
  select(load, tlsd, tlmin, tlmax, meant, nonfossil, so2price, netNSflow, yearseason) %>% 
  summarise_all(mean)

The data preparation is done, now we can define our model. We will perform a restricted spline regression which expands the model from `Exercise 3.2`. The complete model is proposed by Cullen and is defined below. We construct splines for `costratio`, `load`  and `meant` and include the remaining control variables as well as the seasonal dummy variable in a simple linear form.

$$co2mass_{2t}=s(costratio_{t}|\beta)+s(load_{t}|\theta) + s(meant_t|\omega)+X_t\psi+D_\gamma+\epsilon_t$$

#< info "Model variables" 

We introduced some variables in the previous exercises. To get one complete view you find the meaning of all parameters below:  

$co2mass_{t}$: CO2 emissions in tons  
$costratio_{t}$: Cost ratio of coal over gas
$load_{t}$: Daily electricity consumption per interconnection in MWh  
$meant_{t}$: Average daily temperature per interconnection  
$X_{t}$: Non-fossil power generation (e.g. solar, hydro or wind), $SO_{2}$ prices, net imports of electricity import from Canada, variance in load  
$D_\gamma$: Dummy variable to absorb seasonal fluctuations  
$\epsilon_t$: Error-term

#>

**Task:** We will run this regression model once for each interconnection. Therefore, we can save some work and pre-define our model as a variable. Define the model according to `Equation 4` and store it as `model`.
```{r "4_1__5"}
#< fill_in
___ <- co2mass ~ ___(costratio, df=___ + ___(load, df=___ + tlsd + tlmin + tlmax + ___(meant, df=___) + nonfossil + so2price + netNSflow + yearseason

# Sample solution
model <- co2mass ~ ns(costratio, df=5) + ns(load, df=5) + tlsd + tlmin + tlmax + ns(meant, df=5) + nonfossil + so2price + netNSflow + yearseason
```

We defined the custom function `predict.robust()` in Exercise 3.2, which combines `lm_robust()`, `predict()` and evaluates the `confidence intervals` using robust errors. Run the code chunk below to perform the regression and predict the fitted values.

We showed in `Exercise 2`, that cost ratios can be constructed with a variety of different levels of coal and gas costs. Therefore, it is unclear which specific gas costs imply certain changes in emissions. To avoid confusion we will only include costs of natural gas in the plots of our main results.  
Second, we transform emissions from an absolute scale to show the relative change in relation to the predicted fuel costs for 2025, as introduced in `Exercise 2`.  

**Task:** The changes are implemented below. We transform the cost ratios in the creation of our plot in the following code chunk. Just press *check*.

```

The plot shows us the response curve of $CO_2$ emissions to changing gas costs when considering base line natural gas costs of \$5.75. The grey area around the fitted values indicate the 95% confidence interval using robust standard errors. Especially for natural gas costs lower than \$4 we can force a significant reduction in emissions, which end up at roughly 12% reduced emissions for costs lower than \$2. On the other spectrum we observe a small increase in emissions with increasing gas costs. This is basically the opposite direction of fuel-switching we intend, where the marginal costs of coal generators become favorable in relation to gas-generators.  
Nevertheless, we have to be careful about these results. Since we plot our confidence intervals and already analyzed the distribution of our data, we know that most of them are within a range of cost between \$2 and \$9. The uncertainty of our results becomes larger with gas costs outside of these bounds. Additionally, we hinted in `Exercise 3.2` that we have test our results for robustness, which you can find in the info box below.  

#< info "Robustness Checks" 

We conduct two robustness tests for our model. First, we can change the way we define our cost ratio. For our analysis we defined the ratio as coal over gas. Instead we could define the inverse or simply define it as the cost difference of gas and coal. The results hereby are very similar if we adjust the mapping accordingly, therefore we won't provide a plot.  
We can also vary the number of knots. We mentioned before that we should test this to avoid over- or underfitting. 
Below I plotted the fitted values of models that use three to seven knots. For reference the spline regression of our main results with five knots is also included. Adjusting the number of knots changes the flexibility of the regression lines. The response curves which use more than 5 knots tend to overfit our data as they are partly outside of our confidence interval. Overall, choosing five knots is a good compromise.

At first glance, the response curves are comparable across all regions. We can achieve reduction in $CO_2$ emissions of roughly 12% when introducing gas costs of $2. We also observe increasing emission for gas costs that are higher than our baseline costs of \$5.75. However, we notice some differences if we look at the exact course of the curves.  
The decline in emissions of the response curve of the Texas Interconnection (`ERCOT`) starts with higher gas costs and the potential emission reduction is greater. We can come up with some explanations with help of the summary table of Exercise 4. First, the share of non-fossil energy production in Texas is lower than in other regions. This results in strong dependencies towards fossil-fuel generators capacities and fuel-switching will occur sooner. Although we have to remember that fuel-switching has limits e.g. grid or generator capacities. Since we do not include these factors in our model, the very short-term effects are somewhat uncertain.  
The response curve of the `Western Interconnection` reacts much smoother in comparison. Because of the higher proportion of non-fossil power generation of roughly 30% the region is less effected by varying fossil-fuel costs in the short-term. The curve responds very static over a wider range of gas costs without significant changes in emissions. Additionally, for higher gas costs the increase in emissions is clearly lower than for other regions. All these arguments are supported by the fact that the emission rate of the Western Interconnection is about 25% lower in relation to the other regions.  
  
Nevertheless, gas prices are mostly set by supply and demand and without introducing very specific instruments to influence the industry, it is difficult to directly set fuel costs. In the next exercise we will solve this problem by transforming our fuel costs into carbon pricing. Click `Go to next exercise` to continue.

## Exercise 4.2 --  Imputed CO2 Response to Carbon Prices

Up to this point we focused on the effects of changing fuel costs on $CO_2$ emissions. As mentioned before, we have to find an instrument which directly affects the cost efficiencies of our fuel types. Therefore, we discussed carbon pricing in `Exercise 2`, which we will implement in this exercise. We will transform our cost ratios into carbon pricing, plot the results similar to `Exercise 4.1` and afterwards calculate the costs of such a tax.  
We continue to use the same fixed and predicted fuel prices for 2025 to determine the base-line level of emissions. Additionally, we need the carbon contents of both fuel types, which we introduced in `Exercise 2`. The associated values for our fuel types are:  

- Carbon content `Natural Gas`: 117 lbs. carbon/MMBtu or `0.0585 tons/MMBtu`
- Carbon content `Coal`: 210.8 lbs. carbon/MMBtu or `0.1054 tons/MMBtu` (averaged on weighted fuel consumption according to EIA Form 923)  

This exercise builds on the results of `Exercise 4.1`. We transform our cast ratios based on the same data, regression model and use the same fitted values we calculated in the previous exercise. To avoid repeating the same steps, I prepared a data frame that includes the data of all interconnections with `predicted emissions`, `transformed emissions` and `confidence intervals`. We load the data set and store it as `dat`. We also declare the variables for `baseline costs` and `carbon content`.

**Task:** Just press *check*.
```{r "4_2",message=FALSE}
#< task_notest
dat <- read_csv("Data/exercise4_2.csv")
head(dat,3)

# define variables
basegas <- 5.75
basecoal <- 2.25
co2_coal <- 0.0585
co2_gas <- 0.1054
#>
```

In the next step we transform our cost ratios. Since carbon prices are already included into `Equation 3`, we can simply rearrange the equation. The behavior of the function and the relation between cost ratios and carbon pricing is explained in `Exercise 2`. Besides that, all variables of the equation are either part of our data frame or declared as variables. Go ahead and perform the calculation.

$$\tag{4}{P_{co2}}=\frac{CR\cdot{base_{gas}}-{base_{coal}}}{CO_{2,coal}-CR\cdot CO_{2,gas}}$$

**Task:** Calculate carbon prices according to `Equation 4` and store them in a new column named `carbontax`. Store the resulting data frame as `dat_tax`.
```{r "4_2__2",message=FALSE}
#< fill_in
___ <- dat %>% 
  mutate(carbontax = (costratio*___-___)/(___-costratio*___))
#>
# Sample solution
dat_tax <- dat %>% 
  mutate(carbontax = (costratio*basegas-basecoal)/(co2_gas-costratio*co2_coal))
```

**Task:** Use `range()` to get the minimum and maximum of `carbontax`.
```{r "4_2__3"}
#< task
#>
range(dat_tax$carbontax)
```

We calculated negative as well as very high values of carbon taxes. Negative values wouldn't make much sense to consider as a tax in this case. The same is true for values that are extremely high. Because of that we will limit our taxes to a range of $[0,80]$. Note that we will drop around 30% of our data due to carbon prices outside of our bounds.

**Task:** Filter `carbon taxes` according to the data range above and store the data frame into `tax`.
```{r "4_2__4"}
#< fill_in
___ <- dat_tax %>% 
  filter(carbontax >= ___ & carbontax <= ___)
#>
# Sample solution
tax <- dat_tax %>% 
  filter(carbontax >= 0 & carbontax <= 80)
```

The approach to plot our results is similar to Exercise `4.1`. We will filter our data for each interconnection and create our plots, but this time evaluate the response curve of emissions to changing carbon prices. Additionally, we will run the code and interpret the results for all interconnections at once.  

**Task:** Filter the data frame `tax` for interconnection `EAST` and save it to `tax_east`. Since we filter for a string, do not forget to put quotes around the argument.

The plots show the effects of positive carbon taxes on $CO_2$ emissions within a reasonable range. In comparison to the previous results using cost ratios, we are now able to directly interpret the effects of a viable instrument in form of taxes.  
The emission abatement and carbon prices of zero correspond to base-line gas prices we used before. Since we only transform the values on the x-Axis, we observe a similar movement of the response curves as in the previous exercise. Because of the method and available data, the maximum value of taxes for the Western Interconnection is around \$71/ton. Apart from that we can reach between 11% and 12% emission reduction when introducing carbon prices of \$80 (\$71 for WECC).

Considering that the economic effect of carbon prices is controversial (EDF 2008), we have to find an economic and socially acceptable level. To get a better impression, we construct a table which gives us detailed information of emission reductions at certain levels of taxes and the corresponding costs.

**Task:** Just press *check*.
```{r "4_2__8"}

find_closest_value <- function(a) {
  vector <- 1:9
  for(i in 0:8){
   vector[i+1] = mean(a$fit[which.min(abs(a$carbontax - i*10))])
  }
  return(vector)
}
#create a new data frame with tax levels from 0 to 80 in steps of 10 and emissions of each interconnection
temp1 = data.frame(tax=seq(0,80,10),east_emission=round(find_closest_value(tax_east)/100000,1), ercot_emission=round(find_closest_value(tax_ercot)/100000,1), wecc_emission=round(find_closest_value(tax_wecc)/100000,1))

#calculate the percentage change to our baseline level of emissions, additionally sum emissions to get total value of emissions

#calculate the percentage change of total emissions and add total costs of emissions in bn$/year
temp3 <- temp2 %>% 
  mutate(perc_all=round((1-temp2$emission_all/temp2$emission[1])*100,1),
         total_costs=round(temp2$tax*temp2$emission_all/10000*365,1))

#use kable to create a table and change styling accordingly
table <- temp3 %>%
  select(c(1,2,5,3,6,4,7,8,9,10)) %>%

```

The result mostly corresponds to Table 2 in Cullen's paper and shows us the absolute values of abated emissions including their costs. The values at `tax=0` mark the base-line emissions at our predicted prices for gas and coal. The majority of emissions as well as carbon abatement results from the Eastern Interconnection. We can achieve modest emission reductions across all tax levels. Emissions get reduced by 5.7% when introducing carbon prices of 30$. We can directly derive the total costs for such a measure, which would be approximately \$45.6 billion per year. 

The remaining question is whether it's acceptable to introduce such costs on the economy. There's a lot of research that covers the topic of estimating which costs are socially acceptable. Current cost estimates show that the social costs of emissions are way higher than any current carbon tax (Pyndick, 2019), which indicates that even for our highest tax levels the benefits would outweigh the costs. In economic terms, we intend to internalize all negative externalitites and avoid dead-weight loss. In theoretical models we can fully control our tax rates to avoid this effect. Nevertheless, real markets have varying conditions, which we could partly control by combining our tax with additional instruments, e.g. hybrid policies including permits (Pizer, 1997).  

In the next chapter we will conclude our results. Click `Go to next exercise` to continue.

## Exercise 5 -- Discussion and Conclusion

Along this interactive R problem set we answered the question how carbon prices would affect emissions in the U.S. electricity sector. We started by giving an overview of the electricity market and observed how the share of fossil fuels and their prices changed over time. In `Exercise 2` we introduced the theory which enabled us to map carbon pricing by using the variance in cost ratios. With these assumptions we started to develop a mathematical model in `Exercise 3`, which predicted the effects of changing fuel costs on $C0_2$ emissions. We found that emissions respond highly non-linear in electricity markets and introduced advanced statistical methods to meet these requirements. In `Exercise 4`, we finally were able to trace out the emission respond curves to changing carbon prices. We implied that the U.S. energy market conditions are different across each interconnection and gathered statistically robust results for each region.  
We observed a reduction in $CO_2$ emissions of 5.7% when introducing carbon taxes of 30\$. Even higher taxes only resulted in modest reductions of emissions, roughly 10% for a tax level of 70\$. Since modern coal generators are already quite efficient, a low tax would be more efficient to drive carbon dioxide heavy plants out of the markets (Cullen & Renolds, 2016). Nevertheless, we must be cautious with the assumptions we made in our methods. We predicted the relative change of emissions in relation to future coal and gas prices. With recent events around COVID-19 and the oil trade war between Russia and Saudi Arabia, these predictions are highly uncertain. We argued in `Exercise 1`, that the steep fall of gas prices in the United States is mostly driven by the boom of its fracking industry. Since gas and oil prices will most likely remain at lower price levels for the forseeable future and a wide range of fracking companies operate at low margin, we can assume more companies will go out of business in the upcoming months. This could reverse the price fall long term and the results of our model would have to be reevaluated.  
We also included $SO_2$ permits in our model. Per defintion their prices increase over time, which makes the long-term reduction of $SO_2$ plannable and at the same time a profitable investment for institutional traders (there's no option to trade them as retail traders at this moment). Since power plants produce both green-house gases ($SO_2$ and $CO_2$), we would introduce an additional instrument for the same purpose of reducing emissions. The advantage of our tax is, that while $S0_2$ permits can be traded within and between firms, carbon pricing applies across the board.  
Lastly, we just assumed that carbon prices would be a good instrument to efficiently lower emissions. On one side, it generates pressure on the profit margin of electricity suppliers, which indirectly enhances the development of greener technologies. On the other side it leads to higher consumer prices. Furthermore, we can't ignore the fact, that generators of power plants are planned to operate for a set amount of time, which could lead to slower response times as expected.  
Concluding, carbon pricing can be a viable instrument to set the direction in which the energy sector will be headed in the future. Long-term, society will be forced to regulate the market to set limits on air pollution of all green-house gases (including $CO_2$). The so called "externalities" costs - meaning indirect costs like health care due to climate change, will out-weigh the costs of any carbon tax we proposed. Especially the United States would benefit from an emission pricing long term (Muller et al. 2011).
