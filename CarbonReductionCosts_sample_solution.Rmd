Welcome to this `Interactive Problem Set`. During this problem set we will examine the effect of carbon taxes on emissions in the electricity sector. The analysis is based on **"Inferring Carbon Abatement Costs in Electricity Markets: A Revealed Preference Approach using the Shale Revolution"** by Joseph A. Cullen, Erin T. Mansur (2016) - further referred as Cullen. You can downlaod the paper including the author's STATA code from: <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/pol.20150388   target = "_blank"> https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/pol.20150388</a>

## Exercise 1 -- Insights into Energy Markets


In order to meet the requirement to be climate-neutral by the year 2050, the world has to become more energy efficient. Right now the world's energy consumption keeps rising daily and even though new technologies are being developed to produce more `green` electricity, we are still heavily dependant on `fossil fuels`. `Coal` is hereby one of the most important sources of energy, but at the same time the biggest cause of carbon emissions. Reason being that it is easy to store, transport, doesn't alter and is mined in huge quantities all around the world. Given that coal supplies will last for centuries, it is a major goal to find incentitives to reduce its use and therefore `emissions`.
Anotherm major energy source is `natural gas`, which is also a type of fossil fuel, but it's $CO_2$ emissions and heat density are far more efficient. Nevertheless, natural gas wasn't considered to be an real alternative to coal because of higher costs through difficult extracting methods and handling.  
This changed due to the `Shale Revolution`, which started in the early 2000s in the United States. Natural gas began to not only be a by-product of the oil industry, but could now be extracted in large quantities and in a targeted manner. Lanfrancois (2012) estimates, that based on the `Clean Power Plan` introduced by the Obama Administration in 2015, carbon dioxide emissions from the electricity sector could be reduced by roughly 23 to 42 percent by replacing existing coal to gas fired generators.    
  
info("Shale-Revolution") # Run this line (Strg-Enter) to show info
  
Enough background for now, let's start with some interactive tasks. In `Exercise 1` we will get insights into global energy markets and explore time-series data of historic prices and generated power.

**Task:**
Use the `read_csv` command to load the data set `exercise1.csv` and store it in a variable called `dat`. `Read_csv` reports the variable type of each column after execution. This will come handy later on in this exercise. In future exercises we will disable this message.  

info("read.csv() and write.csv()") # Run this line (Strg-Enter) to show info

```{r "1__5"}
# ___ <- read_csv("./Data/exercise1.csv")
dat <- read_csv("./Data/exercise1.csv")
```

**Task:** The first thing we do after loading a new data set is looking at it's structure. Use the `head()` command to display the first **eight** rows of the data set `dat`. When not given a second argument, `head()` displays the first 5 rows on default. Alternatively, the problem set provides a seperate tab. You can click on `data` and get redirected to the `Data Explorer` tab, where you can navigate around the data frame and see some basic statistics.

```{r "1__6"}
# head(dat, ...)
head(dat, 8)
```

The data frame includes 214 observations with **monthly** data from the year 2002 to 2019. It contains generated power in the U.S. as well as prices of `natural gas` in Europe and the United States. Keep in mind that different commodities are traded in different units, coal in metric tons (`\$/mt`) and gas in million British thermal units (`\$/mmBTU`). 
I mentioned that it would come handy to know which data types your columns inherit (hovering over the column names in the output above will give you the same information). `R` requires `dates` to be stored as type `Date` to be able to create plots along a time line. Since the date column is currently stored as type `character` we have to convert the date variable into a `date format` by using `as.Date()`.

**Task:**  Transform the data type with `as.Date()` and save it to the same column.
```{r "1__7"}
# ... <- ...(dat$date, format="%m/%d/%Y")
dat$date <- as.Date(dat$date, format="%m/%d/%Y")
```

Now that we imported our data set and processed it for analysis, let's start exploring. First, we create a plot that tells us more about the price development of gas in both regions. Because of the fact that the `Shale-Revolution` started with the beginning of this century, we expect a increasing supply and therefore falling prices for gas in the United States. Since commodity markets are split into regions, the European Prices should somewhat differ.  
Besides basic funtionality that `R` provides on default, there are several packages to create highly customizable plots. We will mostly use the package `ggplot2`, which is widely considered to be one of the most powerful packages to create plots, having the downside that the handling can be a bit tricky. Therefore, you aren't required to create entire plots on your own but to fill gaps in code blocks. This way you will learn how the logic behind `ggplot2` and at the same time won't be frustrated if the output doesn't meet the exact requirements.  
  
**Task:** Use the data frame `dat` to plot `historic prices` of natural gas in `Europe` and the `United States`. Just press *check*.

info("ggplot2") # Run this line (Strg-Enter) to show info
```{r "1__8",fig.width=9, fig.height=6, dev='svg'}
ggplot(data=dat, aes(x=date)) +
  geom_line(aes(y=dat$price_naturalgas_USA, color="United States"), size=1) +
  geom_line(aes(y=dat$price_naturalgas_Europe, color="Europe"), size=1) +
  labs(x = "Year", y = "", title = "Natural Gas Prices", subtitle = "Y=$/mmBTU")+
  scale_color_manual(name="Region",values = c("blue","red"))
```

Looking at the plot our assumptions are confirmed. The spikes in 2005 and 2008 are mostly consequences of the Iraq War and the Financial Crisis. Apart from that, we observe decreasing gas prices in the U.S. from just over \$12 in 2008 to under \$2 in 2016. Since then the prices remained at roughly the same level. Natural gas prices in Europe have remained at a significantly higher level. One reason being is that fracking isn't as popular in Europe, therefore a major part of gas gets imported from Russia which drives prices. Another reason is that Europe has a widely different energy mix than the United States. According to the European Environment Agency (EEA), the consumption of gas decreased in average by 1.4% per year since 2005, whereas in the U.S. natural gas reached new all-time highs nearly every year. 

////////?Because of the lack of data provided by state officials in Europe, the analysis in this problem set will further purely focus on the U.S. market.

Besides the development of prices, the consumption is another relevant factor. Before getting an insight into the generated power for coal and gas, take your first quiz:


Quiz: Do you think that the proportion of gas generated electicity compared to coal generated electricity has increased or decreased over time?

- increased [x]

- decreased [ ]

&nbsp;

**Task:** Create a new `ggplot2` for electricity generation. Plot the `date` on the x-Axisand the generated electricity on the y-Axis. We want seperate line for `gas generated power` as well as `coal generated power`. Lines are drawn with `geom_line`. For reference you can look at the code from the previous graph or conduct the `help()` function.

```{r "1__9",fig.width=9, fig.height=6, dev='svg'}
#ggplot(data=___, aes(x=___)) +
#  ____(aes(_=dat$generated_coal, color="Coal Generation (TWh)"), size=1, alpha=0.5) +
#  ____(aes(_=dat$generated_gas, color="Natural Gas Generation (TWh)"), size=1, alpha=0.5) +
#  labs(x = "Year", y = "", title = "Monthly Generation by Fueltype", subtitle = "Y=Monthly Electricty (TWh)")+
#  scale_color_manual(name="",values = c("black","red"))+
#  scale_y_continuous(breaks=seq(0,200,25))
ggplot(data=dat, aes(x=date)) +
  geom_line(aes(y=dat$generated_coal, color="Coal Generation (TWh)"), size=1, alpha=0.5) +
  geom_line(aes(y=dat$generated_gas, color="Natural Gas Generation (TWh)"), size=1, alpha=0.5) +
  labs(x = "Year", y = "", title = "Monthly Generation by Fueltype", subtitle = "Y=Monthly Electricty (TWh)")+
  scale_color_manual(name="",values = c("black","red"))+
  scale_y_continuous(breaks=seq(0,200,25))
```

The results are in line with what we should expect. With a higher supply of gas and decreasing prices, gas plants increased their share in power generation over time. Giving you a bit more background information: Coal-fired plants have lower operating costs than gas-fired generators, but are expensive to start and slow to adjust to fluctuating demands. Gas-generators can fill these gaps. There are two different types of gas-generators, one being `peaker plants`. They run in high demand hours due to their fast start-up times but on the downside have high marginal costs. The other type are `combined cycle gas turbines` (CCGT). They have low heat rates (high efficiency of turning fuel into power) and are used to provide baseline power generation throughout the day.  
Combining the factors above and the possiblity to use both fuels to generate power in all situation, we can say that the fuels are `switchable`. However, the mechanism of `fuel switching` is a lot more complex than just about changing fuel prices. Factors like capacity of plants, transmission grid limits (Mansur & White 2012, Davis & Hausman 2015) or firms market power (Bushnell, Mansur & Saravia 2008) also play a big role. We try to include some but not all of these factors in our later analysis.  
To wrap this up, we observe severe fluctuations, that occur yearly with a smaller peak in summer and a bigger in the winter season. The fluctuation are largely driven by Residential using air conditioning in summer and space heating in winter (EIA, "Today in Energy", 2020/3).  
  

In the next exercise we will go through necessary theory for our main analysis. Click `Go to next exercise` to continue.




## Exercise 2 -- Theory

### Relationship between Fuel and Carbon Prices

In this exercise we will dive into the theory of `fuel switching` and how we could exploit this for our analysis. We already introduced factors that effect the effeciency of power plants. 


We already introduced factors that effect the cost efficiency of fuel types or in other words the costs to produce additional power, so called `marginal costs`.


ot an idea, that different fuel types have different costs to produce additional power, so called `marginal costs`. Cullen (2016) developed a model which builds upon the idea, that different fuel prices have different  we will As seen in the last exercise there are more factors to `marginal costs` than just the commodity prices itself. With that in mind we define the `marginal costs` of fossil-powered plants as a Equation of `heat rate` and the `costs of burning fuel`. Variable names of this exercise are explained in the info-box above:

$$\tag{1}MC=HR\cdot(P_{fuel}+CO_{2,fuel}\cdot P_{co2})=HR\cdot C_{fuel}$$

info("Variable names in this exercise") # Run this line (Strg-Enter) to show info

In `Exercise 1` we observed generated electricity of `coal` and `gas` and their variance over time. Because of the fact that the cost efficiency of coal is generally better, we have to introduce a incentive to reduce the use of coal in relation to gas in electricity generation. One way to introdude a change in cost efficiency is to propose `carbon prices`. This is especially viable in this case because coal contains approximately `twice` as much $CO_2$ as natural gas and therefore stronger effects the cost efficiency. Another factor that drives this momentum is that gas generators generally have a more efficient heat rate than coal generators (as metioned at the end of last exercise).  
Combining these two facts of cost and generation efficiency lead to `steeper marginal cost` for coal generators when carbon prices are introduced. Reflecting this to our upcoming analysis, we don't observe any carbon prices, but a time-series of fuel prices that are transformed into burning costs with equation `(1)`. To implement the mechanism of `fuel change` we introduce a `coal-gas ratio`, which we define as followed:

$$\tag{2}costratio=\frac{C_{coal}}{C_{gas}}$$

Combining Equation `1` and `2`, we can explain `cost ratios` as a function of `fuel prices`, `carbon content` and `carbon prices`:

$$\tag{3}costratio=\frac{C_{coal}}{C_{gas}}=\frac{P_{coal}+CO_{2,coal}\cdot P_{co2}}{P_{gas}+CO_{2,gas}\cdot P_{co2}}$$

For completeness we introduce values for carbon content $CO_{2,coal}$ and  $P_{fuel}$, that will be fixed based on predictions for the year 2025. The `EIA` reports carbon content and forcasts for fuel prices. We will use these values later on in our analysis:  

- Average delivered coal price `$2.25/mmBTU` and gas prices `$5.75/mmBTU` (forcast for 2025)
- Carbon content `Natural Gas`: 117 lbs carbon/MMBTU or `0.0585 tons/MMBTU`  
- Carbon content `Coal`: 210.8 lbs carbon/MMBTU or `0.1054 tons/MMBTU`  

Lets quickly interpret `Equation 2`: The `price ratio` will rise for higher `costs of burning coal` or lower `costs of burning gas`. To make this even clearer, lets visualize the relationship, which replicates Figure 4 of Cullen.

<img src="./Material/relationship.png" alt="drawing" width="600"/>
Source: Cullen (2016)  
  
Panel `(a)` shows the relationship between fixed costs of `coal` and `gas` when `carbon prices` get introduced. As shown before we observe higher marginal costs for coal and at a certain value of carbon prices, gas becomes more cost efficient. Panel `(c)` shows the results when transforming fuel prices in price ratios as defined in `Equation 2`. We can observe the same in absence of carbon prices with fixed coal prices and variable gas prices as seen in panel `(b)` and `(d)`. 


Quiz: Do you think we can create any given price ratio under the assumption that we introduce carbon prices under fixed fuel prices? The answer is basically shown in the graphs above.

- Yes [x]

- No [ ]

&nbsp;

The answer is the central idea to our analysis. We can create every variation of cost ratios, either by introducing `carbon prices` to fixed fuel prices, or without carbon prices by varying costs of `coal` and `gas`. We use this variation in the cost ratios observed in our data to understand how emissions change when gas generators become more competitive with coal plants (Cullen 2016). 

$$\tag{4}{P_{co2}}=\frac{costratio\cdot{P_{gas}}-{P_{coal}}}{CO_{2,coal}-costratio\cdot CO_{2,gas}}$$

We will use this equation in the second part of the analysis (`4.2`) to transform our fuel costs into carbon prices. Therefore we will be able to predict the impact of carbon taxes on emissions and calculate abatement costs.

Since it is not common to have electricity grid in Europe that are formed like the ones in the United States, I will introduce the concept of interconnection in the following sub-section.

### Interconnections

<img src="./Material/interconnections.png" alt="drawing" width="600"/>
Source: Cullen (2016)

The American Electric system is made up of three major `interconnections`, which in turn concist of different balancing authorities (responsible for maintaining the electricity balance within the region). Local electricity grids are hereby connected to form a network, which provides higher stablity and reliability. These `interconnections` operate mostly independent from each other and exchange little to no electricity. This is a huge difference to the European electricity grid, where grid stability is ensured across borders.

In the graph below you can see the `3` interconnection we include data of in this problem set. I listed a few details for each below:
- `Eastern Interconnection (EAST)`: Consists of 36 balancing authorities and extends from the East Coast to the Rocky Mountains.
- `Western Interconnection (WECC)`: Involves 37 balancing authorities, which are located in the West of North America.
- `Electric Reliability Council of Texas` (ERCOT): Consists of large parts of Texas

In the first part of this exercise we already hinted that our model will we some form of regression of price ratios against emissions. Since we are essentially observing three different energy markets we should confirm the distribution of our data points. Therefore we create a graph that plots all price ratios within our data set against $CO_2$ emissions. We run the model seperately on each interconnection if find a large distribution across interconnections. We will present the data set for the analysis in detail in upcoming exercises. For not it's enough to get an impression on the distribution.

**Task:** Just press *check*.

info("geom_encircle") # Run this line (Strg-Enter) to show info

 //////////// rename data set

```{r "2",message=FALSE}
dat <- read_csv("Data/exercise3.csv")
ggplot(dat,aes(x=coalprice/gasprice,y=co2mass/1000,color=intercn))+
        geom_point(alpha=0.2) +
        geom_encircle(aes(group=intercn,fill=intercn),alpha=0.3, s_shape=1) +
        theme_bw()+ 
        labs(y="", 
        x="Price Ratio", 
        subtitle="y=CO2 Emissions in 1000 tons/day",
        title="Distribution of data")
```

As you can the distribution of data point for the `Eastern` interconnection is way different than the other two interconnections. We could probably find a model that fits `ERCOT` and `WECC`, but its unlikely to fit well for `EAST`. Because of this we will perform our analysis on each `interconnection` seperately. 


In the next chapter we will begin constructing a model that will implement the theory we introduced in this exercise. Click `Go to next exercise`.
































## Exercise 3.1 -- Emission Response Curves - A simple Approach

A short recapture: We got an idea about fuel shares in the U.S. energy market and introduced `interconnection`. Furthermore we introduced the concept of `fuel switching` and necessary theory behind mapping carbon pricing. In `Chapter 3` we will combine these findings and start developing a regression model. #########We will start by proposing a simple linear regression, analyze the statistics and work our way along to a fitting model.

If you are purely interested in the final model and the economic impact, you can skip to `Exercise 4.1`. `Chapter 3` will focus on regression theory, which will guide you to the final model.

**Task:** To get started, load the data set `exercise3.csv`, press `edit` and `check` afterwards.

```{r "3_1",message=FALSE}
dat <- read_csv("Data/exercise3.csv")
head(dat,3)
```

The data are gathered from several official U.S. agencies and aggregated to a daily level and seperated by interconnection. Along the way we will extend the data set with further variables. For now you can find the variables and it's associated units below:

`co2mass`: $CO_2$ emissions in tons  
`gasprice`: Capacity weighted average daily gas price per interconnetion ($ per million BTU)  
`coalprice`: Price of Coal ($ per million BTU)  
`load`: Daily electricity consumption per interconnection in MWh  

Because of the size of the original data sets we wont do the data preparation in this problem set but rather provide the data sources. `Emission` data are measured by the Continuous Emissions Monitoring System (CEMS) of the `Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)`. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) collects data of `coal prices` in Form 923. Spot prices for `gas` can be found at the `Intercontinental Exchange (ICE)` and data for `electricity consumption` or `load` are provided by the `Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC)` in Form 714.

In `Exercise 2` we saw that it makes sense for us to run our model on each `interconnection` seperatly. For this purpose we will filter our data set for interconnection `EAST` and develop the model based on these data. Once we found a fitting model we will run it on each interconnection. Before we start with modelling we alter our data set with the implications from above. For ease of interpretation we convert emissions and load from tons to million tons.  

**Task:** Use the pipe operator `%>%` to combine following tasks: Filter the data set `dat` for interconnection `EAST` and store the new data frame in variable `dat_east`. Additionally, calculate the cost ratio between `coalprice` and `gasprice` according to `Equation 2`.

info("Pipe, Select, Filter, Mutate") # Run this line (Strg-Enter) to show info

```{r "3_1__3"}
# ___ <- data ___ 
#  mutate(costratio = ___/___,
#         co2mass = co2mass/1000000),
#         load = load/1000000) %>%
#  filter(intercn=="___")
dat_east <- dat %>% 
  mutate(costratio = coalprice/gasprice,
         co2mass = co2mass/1000000,
         load = load/1000000) %>%
  filter(intercn=="EAST")
```



### Stage 1: Linear Regression

We start by proposing a simple linear regression model. In a mathematical way we can express the relationship as followed:

$$CO_{2t}=\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}\cdot costratio_{t}+\epsilon_t$$


info("Linear Regression with lm()") # Run this line (Strg-Enter) to show info

**Task:** Run a regression with `co2mass` as the dependent variable and `costratio` as independent variable. Store it in the variable `fit1`. 
```{r "3_1__5"}
# ... <- lm(...~... , data=dat_east)
fit <- lm(co2mass ~ costratio, data=dat_east)
```

**Task:** To show the statistics of our regression we will use stargazer(). Since we won't need every information that is shown by the default function. We will define our own and at the same time introduce custom functions which will be useful later on. Read the `Info Boxes` to find out more about `stargazer` and `custom functions` and continue with the next `task`. Press **check** to define the functiom.

info("Stargazer") # Run this line (Strg-Enter) to show info

info("Custom functions") # Run this line (Strg-Enter) to show info

```{r "3_1__8"}
show.regression= function(...){
  library(stargazer)
    stargazer(..., 
            type = "text", 
            style = "aer",  
            digits = 3,
            df = FALSE,
            report = "vct*",
            star.cutoffs = c(0.05, 0.01, 0.001),
            model.names = FALSE,
            object.names = TRUE,
            model.numbers = FALSE, 
            omit.stat=c("f", "ser")
    )
}
```


Quiz: Before looking at the summary, what impact do changing cost ratios have on emissions?

- With increasing cost ratios emissions will increase. [ ]

- With increasing cost ratios emissions will fall. [x]

  
  
**Task:** Use the function we just defined to show the summary of `fit1`.
```{r "3_1__9"}
show.regression(fit)
```


We observe a positive intercept term $\beta_0$ with 5.87704 and a negative coefficient for $\beta_1$ of -1.30554, meaning that emissions fall with an increasing cost ratio. The three stars next to our coefficents imply, that the p-value is smaller than 0.1. That suggests that our data our inconsistent with the null hypothesis and that the null hyphithesis may be rejected. In other words the probabiliy of finding an estimator that is at least as high as the one we predicted is smaller than one percent. 

Our eventual goal is to plot the rensponse curves of changing ??AWD prices

### Stage 2: Multivariate Regression Model

If we look back at the implications of the energy market from `Exercise 1`, we know that there are several other factors that should influence $CO_2$ emissions. To control for other effects we can use `multivariate regression models` and include additional factors. For now we add the effects of `generated electricity`. Our regression formula changes to following:  

$$CO_{2t}=\beta_0+\beta_1\cdot costratio_t+\beta_2\cdot load_t+\epsilon_t$$

**Task:** Just press **check**

```{r "3_1__11"}
fit1 = lm(co2mass ~ costratio + load, data=dat_east)

show.regression(fit,fit1)
```

TEXT

info("R-squared") # Run this line (Strg-Enter) to show info






Our goal is to find the response curves of emissions to changing fuel price. Therefore, we want to plot our fitted values of emissions against costs. First off, we need to predict the emission value of our model. 





**Task:** Predict the fitted values of `fit2` on `dat_east` with help of the `predict()` function.

info("Predict") # Run this line (Strg-Enter) to show info

```{r "3_1__12"}
co2.hat1 = predict(fit1, dat_east)
```


As explained before our eventual goal is to plot the response curves of emissions to changing fuel prices (or cost ratios). Simply evaluating the fitted values on our intitial data frame as we have done in the last task won't give us an interpretable curve though. A multivariate regression with two dependent variables spans three dimensions. To illustrate this problem run the code below.


**Task:** Just press **check**
```{r "3_1__13",fig.width=9, fig.height=6, dev='svg'}
#take sample from data to limit points shown in plot
temp<- dat_east %>% cbind(co2.hat1)
temp1<- temp[sample(nrow(temp), 150), ]
#assign vairables to axises
x <- temp1$costratio
y <- temp1$load
z <- temp1$co2.hat1
#set a nice color scheme
numbercol <- 8 # number of colors
plotcolor <- brewer.pal(numbercol,"Blues") # use Brewer to get color scheme 
colornum <- cut(rank(z), numbercol, labels=FALSE)
colorcode <- plotcolor[colornum] # assign color
#plot
s3d <- scatterplot3d(x,y,z, col.axis="gray", col.grid="gray", type="h",color=colorcode, 
angle = 35, scale.y = 1, pch = 19, xlab="Cost Ratio", ylab = "Load", zlab = "Emissions")
s3d$plane3d(fit1, lty = "dotted")
```

Because of the amount of data points we gathered in our prediction we limit our plot to a sample size. The predicted emissions are plotted as a dot in the z-axis and the regression plane is placed along side. We see that the plane spans over three dimensions and there no exact "line" to be drawn here. We could pursue this type of visualization but because of clearness we want our results to be plotted on a plane. If we would continue and simply plot these predicted values we would get a weird out. For purpose of illustration, run the code below to see what would happen if we plot emissions against cost ratios.

**Task:** Just press **check**
```{r "3_1__14"}
ggplot(dat_east,aes(x=costratio,y=co2.hat1))+
        geom_line(aes(x=dat_east$costratio, y=co2.hat1))+
        labs(y="Emissions", x="Cost Ratio")
```

`R` hereby follows it's intential function and connects all points, which is not the desired output we want to see. We could interpret falling emission for higher cost ratios but a more detailed analysis isn't possible. To solve this issue we will use a work around in the way that we won't predict our values on the original data we build our model on. Instead we will evaluate all independent variables with exception of cost ratios at their respective mean.  
We are able to do so, because the average of the fitted values $\hat{y_i}$ is equal to the average of the actual values $y_i$:  

$$\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n \hat{y_i}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n y_i$$

This is true for linear regressions with intercept term (Sarndal, Swensson and Wretman, 1992). As a side note, the sum of the residuals in this case are zero.

To implement this method we create a new data set. Since we only added `load` to our model for now, we include `costratio` and the mean value of `load`. This will serve as our data frame to run `predict()` on. We will plot the response curves again at the end of this exercise.

**Task:** Just press **check**.
```{r "3_1__15"}
pred_dat = tibble(costratio = dat_east$costratio) %>%
  cbind(load=mean(dat_east$load))
```

Not that we are able to plot multivariate regressions into a two-dimensional grid, we continue to further develop our model. Our previous model assumed a linear relationship between emissions and fuel prices. Given the complexity of electricity markets and the statistics we gathered up until now, we should assume a more complex relationship in form of a highly non-linear response of emissions.  The type of regression that fits a non-linear relationship between the dependent and independent variables is called `Polynomial Regression` and the easiest method that makes sense for us in this case is to replace the linear model with a cubic function:

$$CO_{2t}=\beta_0+\beta_1\cdot costratio_t+\beta_2\cdot costratio_t^2+\beta_3\cdot costratio_t^3+\beta_4\cdot load_t+\epsilon_t$$

**Task:** To implement a cubic function we use the `poly()` function. We could include all grades of the polynomical function but since `R` includes them on it's own, it is enough to define it as followed. Just press **check**.
```{r "3_1__16"}
fit2 = lm(co2mass ~ poly(costratio,3) + load, data=dat_east)
show.regression(fit, fit1, fit2)
```

You can see the summary for every regression we have run so far. As mentioned we get a coefficient for every grade of the polynomial function. 



To finally plot our models once again , we first use 
**Task:** Run `predict()` on `fit1` and `fit2`. Use the data frame `pred_dat` to calculate the fitted values.
```{r "3_1__17"}
#co2.hat1 = ___
#co2.hat2 = ___
co2.hat1 = predict(fit1, pred_dat)
co2.hat2 = predict(fit2, pred_dat)
```

**Task:** Create a new ggplot. Use `geom_line()` to plot one line each for `co2.hat1` and `co2.hat2`, with `cost ratios` on the x-axis and `emissions` on the y-axis.
```{r "3_1__18"}
#ggplot(pred_dat,aes(x=costratio,y=dat_east$co2mass))+
#   geom_line(aes(___), color="red") +
#   geom_line(aes(___), color="green") +
ggplot(pred_dat,aes(x=costratio,y=dat_east$co2mass))+
    geom_line(aes(x=costratio, y=co2.hat1, color="linear")) +
    geom_line(aes(x=costratio, y=co2.hat2, color="non-linear")) +
    scale_color_manual(name="",values = c("black","red"))+
    labs(x="Cost Ratio", y="Emissions")
```

The plot shows us the two regression lines for the linear and non-linear regression model. With the method of predicting our fitted values to mean values we get a clear trend to interpret our results. Furthermore, the non-linear model seems to reflect the real-world a lot better. Because of technological and capacity restriction it is unlikely that emissions can increase in a linear fashion without restrictions. That effect also applies for higher cost ratios.  

Going forward we will improve the method of fitting a polynomial function to our model 




## Exercise 3.2 -- Restricted Cubic Spline Regressions

### Stage 3: Cubic Spline

In this exercise we will introduce the conecpt of `restricted spline regressions` and it's use for our analysis. In the world of craftman's the term splines would refer to a strip of wood that is being shaped into a smooth curve. Hereby the strip would be forced around fixed points and form a natural spline. In the world of mathematics these splines are defined as a form of piece-wise polynomial functions, which usually consist of cubic polynomials. `Knots` refer to the fixed points in mathematical splines and are placed along the range of data. As we ajust the number of knots the spline becomes more or less flexible. Mind here that this can lead to over or underfitting of the fitted curve. To confirm the correctness of our results we will later on conduct a quick robustness check where we adjust the number of knots. Finally, our model will be `restricted` , meaning that the spline is constrained to be linear in front of the first knot and after the last one.  


**Task:** To start with spline regression, load the required data. We use the same data and interconnection `EAST` as in the last exercise. Just press check.
```{r "3_2",message=FALSE}
dat_east <- read_csv("Data/exercise3_2.csv")
```

**Task:** Fit a regression model, which regresses `costratio` and `load` as natural splines with 5 degrees of freedom against `co2mass`. Use the data frame `dat_east`.  

info("ns()") # Run this line (Strg-Enter) to show info

```{r "3_2__3",message=FALSE}
#fit3 = lm(co2mass ~ ns(costratio,df = 5)+ns(load, df=5), data=dat_east )
fit3 = lm(co2mass ~ ns(costratio,df = 5)+ns(load, df=5), data=dat_east )
```

**Task:** Use `show.regression()` to get the summary statistics of `fit3`.
```{r "3_2__4"}
#
show.regression(fit3)
```

The output is comparable to one of simple polynomial regressions by getting a coefficient for every knot 



### Error Newey

To show that our data are an example of heteroskedasticity, we can simply create a plot that follows the same method as before:

**Task:** Just press check.
```{r "3_2__5",warning=FALSE}
pred_dat = tibble(costratio = dat_east$costratio) %>%
  cbind(load=mean(dat_east$load))
co2.hat3 = predict(fit3, pred_dat)
ggplot(pred_dat,aes(x=costratio,y=dat_east$co2mass))+
    geom_point(alpha=0.3) + 
    geom_line(aes(x=costratio, y=co2.hat3), color="red") + 
    scale_y_continuous(limits=c(4,6))
```


As we should expect we continue to see a negative relationship between cost ratios and $CO_2$ emissions. However, as cost ratios increase, the difference between our regression line and the observation tend to become larger. This is a strong indicator that our model suffers from `heteroskedasticity`. Since standard models relies on the assumption that theres no correlation between the independent variables and the variance of the dependent variables, we shouldn't rely on standard errors, but calculate `heteroskedasticity robust standard errors`.  
R packages normally provide a lot of handy functions to predict fitted values and at the same time calculate robust standard errors. Because of the fact that we are not predicting on the same data frame as we build our model on, this gets a bit tricky. Therefore I wrote a custom function which is uses the `NeweyWest()` function.


//////////////////








## Exercise 4 -- Examining Carbon Abatement


In the following chapter we shift our focus away from theory and work our way towards our final results. To approach our analysis we split it into two parts:

- First, we will use the methods we introduced to determine the $CO_2$ response curves to changing fuel costs. (`Exercise 4.1`)

- Afterwards, we transform these fuel prices into carbon prices and plot the abatement curves. (`Exercise 4.2`)

To this point we limited our data to fuel prices and generated electricity (`load`). We will use this exercise to explain and add additional effects to our data frame and get a final impression of what we are working with. 

**Task:** Load the data set `main_data.csv` into a variable `dat` and show the first 3 rows.

```{r "4",message=FALSE}
#___ <- read_csv("./Data/___")
#___
dat <- read_csv("./Data/main_data.csv")
head(dat,3)
```
&nbsp;
The data frame is a combination of data we used in previous exercises and in adds several factors. The variables we add here are explained below:

`tlsd`, `tlmin`, `tlmax`: Standard deviation, minimum and maximum of load  
`meant`: Average daily temperature per interconnection  
`nonFossil`: Electricity generation with non-fossil fuel in MWh  
`so2price`: Permit prices of $SO_2$ ($/ton)  
`netNSflow`: Electricity flowing from Canada to US by interconnection and month in MWh  

The data are gathered from several official U.S. agencies and continue to be aggregated to a daily level and seperated by interconnection. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) provides data for `Non-fossil` energy production, permit prices for $SO_2$ are collected from the `EPA Clean Air Markets` and finally, `net imports` of electricity from Canada are gathered from the `National Energy Board of Canada`. Links to the sources can be found in the `References` section.

Until now we haven't considered the seasonal variance in load. As we have seen in `Exercise 1`, load heavily varies with a smaller peak in summer and a bigger one in winter. To adjust for this effect we create a dummy variable that controls for years and seasons (off-season/summer/winter). 

**Task:** Calculate the seaonal variable and show the first few rows. Just press *check*.
```{r "4__2"}
dat_final <- dat %>% 
        mutate(season=(month>3) + (month>6) + (month>9),
                       yearseason=year*10+season)

head(dat_final,3)
```

The data set above will act as our final data frame we use our data on. 

**Task:** Use `group_by()` to group the dataset `dat` by `intercn`. Afterwards use `summarise_all()` to calculate the means of every column. For formatting we use the package `kable`. Just press **checK**.

info("Group_by() and summarise()") # Run this line (Strg-Enter) to show info
  
info("kable()") # Run this line (Strg-Enter) to show info


**Task:** Just press **check**.
```{r "4__4"}
dat_final %>% 
  select(intercn, co2mass, load, coalprice, gasprice, costratio, nonfossil) %>% 
  group_by(intercn) %>% 
  mutate(co2mass = co2mass/1000, load=load/1000, "Emission Rate"=co2mass/load, nonfossil=nonfossil/100000) %>% 
  summarise_all("mean") %>% 
  kable(format="html", align="c", col.names = c("intercn","Emissions","Load","Gas Price","Coal Price","Price Ratio","Non Fossil","Emission Rate")) %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed"), position = "center", full_width = F)
```

The table reports the mean of important variables for each interconnection. We can clearly see that `EAST` is by far the largest of the observed energy markets. The emissions seem to increase proportionally to the electricity consumption if we take the electricity production from non-fossil sources in consideration. This gets clearer if the look at the emission rates, which are defined as $ER=\frac{emissions}{load}$. Therefore the `Western` interconnection has by far the `greenest` energy production, followed with some distance by Texas (`ERCOT`) and the `Eastern` interconnection. Furthermore we observe clear variations in price ratios.   This is in line with our assumptions from `Section 2`, where we stated that each interconnection has vastly different conditions and therefore should conduct our regression on each seperatly. In the next exercise we will use this data set and the regression theory we presented in `Chapter 3` to trace out the emission response curves.

## Exercise 4.1 -- Estimated CO2 Response to Fuel Prices

In this exercise we expand the regression model from the previous Exercise and determine the $CO_2$ response curves to changing fuel prices. In the first step we will perform a regresson based on the methods we introduced in the previous chapter. Afterwards we will use this model to predict emissions and plot a response curve that gives us percentage changes based on predicted fuel prices of 2025.

As a side note, the code isn't meant to be the shortest or the most efficient, but should allow you to follow each step we take to get our final results. Based on this we will explain and carry out the analysis step by step for interconnection `EAST`, afterwards apply it to `ERCOT` and `WECC` and interpret our results.

Building upon the model we defined in the last chapter, we will expand our regression model with several control variables as followed. The meaning and source of data to every variable is explained in the info box below:

First, we load and prepare the data to run the ///////// SEASONAL VARIABLE

**Task:** Load the dataframe and store it in `dat`. create the seasonable dummy variable. 
```{r "4_1",message=FALSE}
dat <- read_csv("Data/main_data.csv") %>% 
        mutate(season=(month>3) + (month>6) + (month>9),
                       yearseason=year*10+season)
head(dat,3)
```

**Task:** Filter the data set for intercn `EAST`.
```{r "4_1__2"}
#east <- filter(...,...)
east <- filter(dat, intercn=="EAST")
```

**Task:** Calculate the `mean` of every variable we use in our regression. First, select the necessary columns and then use `summarise_all` to get the `mean`. Store the result in `mean_east`.
```{r "4_1__3"}
# ... <- east %>% 
#  select(load, tlsd, tlmin, tlmax, meant, nonfossil, so2price, netNSflow, yearseason) %>% 
#  summarise_all(...)
mean_east <- east %>% 
  select(load, tlsd, tlmin, tlmax, meant, nonfossil, so2price, netNSflow, yearseason) %>% 
  summarise_all(mean)
```

**Task:** To make our life a bit easier we will create a new data set with `gasprice`, `priceratio` and the results of the `last` task. Use `tibble()`, which creates a new data frame and `cbind()`, which takes a sequence of columns and combines them with another data frame.

```{r "4_1__4"}
#temp_east <- ...(gasprice = east$gasprice, priceratio = east$priceratio) %>% 
#  ...(mean_east)
predict_east <- tibble(date=east$date, intercn=east$intercn, co2mass=east$co2mass, gasprice = east$gasprice, coalprice=east$coalprice, costratio = east$costratio) %>% 
  cbind(mean_east)
```


#We will perform a reduced-form regression which expands the cubic spline regression from exercise `3.2` and builds upon the theory of `exercise 2`. We define the model as followed: ??????????

$$\tag{5}CO_{2t}=s(priceratio_{t}|\beta)+s(load_{t}|\theta) + s(temp_t|\omega)+X_t\psi+D_\gamma+\epsilon_t$$

info("Model variables") # Run this line (Strg-Enter) to show info



**Task:** Perform the regression model we described in the beginning of this exercise for interconnection `EAST`. Use `ns()` for variables with spline regression (as explained in `3.3`). We want to use `5` degrees of freedom. Store the resulting model in `reg_east`.
```{r "4_1__5"}
#... <- lm(co2mass ~ ...(priceratio, df=...) + ...(load, df=...) + tlsd + tlmin + tlmax + ...(meant, df=...) + nonfossil + so2price + netNSflow + yearseason, data=east)
reg_east <- lm(co2mass ~ ns(costratio, df=5) + ns(load, df=5) + tlsd + tlmin + tlmax + ns(meant, df=5) + nonfossil + so2price + netNSflow + yearseason, data=east)
```

**Task:** Predict $CO_2$ emissions based on the regression model `reg_east` and `temp_east`. We set interval to `confidence` to get the mean interval and be able to plot a confidence band later on.

In the next exercise we will map the emission response curves from this exercise into carbon prices and estimate the effects of carbon prices on emissions as well as the associated costs. Click `Go to next exercise` to continue.


## Exercise 4.2 --  Imputed CO2 Response to Carbon Prices

In the last exercise we found out that changing cost ratios of `coal` and `gas` could greatly reduce $CO_2$ emissions. What we are interested though is the question how carbon prices effect emissions. This exercise will follow the analysis of Cullen and we transform the cost ratios into `carbon prices`. This will allow us to estimate the effect of carbon taxes on $CO_2$ emissions and we can approximate the costs of such reductions. We use `Equation 3` to transform the prices and afterwards plot and calculate our final results based on the model we defined in `Exercise 4.1`.

We assume the same fixed and predicted fuel prices for 2025 as before and additionally define the fuels associated carbon contents (EIA 2019):

- Average delivered coal price `$2.25/mmBTU` and gas prices `$5.75/mmBTU` for 2025. 
- Carbon content `Natural Gas`: 117 lbs carbon/MMBTU or `0.0585 tons/MMBTU`
- Carbon content `Coal`: 210.8 lbs carbon/MMBTU or `0.1054 tons/MMBTU` (averaged on weighted fuel consumption according to EIA Form 923)

To avoid repeating the same steps as in the last exercise, I prepared a data set that includes the predicted `emissions` as well as the `tranformed emissions` with confidence intervals. Load the data set `main_data2.csv` and store it in `dat`. Use the `head()` command to show the first rows. We also declare the variables for `base prices` and `carbon content`.

**Task:** Just press *check*.
```{r "4_2",message=FALSE}
dat <- read_csv("Data/main_data2.csv")
head(dat,3)

basegas <- 5.75
basecoal <- 2.25
gas_cc <- 0.0585
coal_cc <- 0.1054
```

In the next step we go ahead and transform the cost ratios into carbon prices using `Equation 3`. For reference I included it below once again. Based on the method and cost ratios in our data we also get negative carbon taxes after the transformation. Since it doesn't make much sense for use to consider these, we will filter them out. For reference or when you decided to skip to this Exercise I once again include `Equation 3`:  

$$\tag{3}{P_{co2}}=\frac{CR\cdot{P_{gas}}-{P_{coal}}}{CO_{2,coal}-CR\cdot CO_{2,gas}}$$

**Task:** Create a new column `carbontax` using `Equation 3` and filter the just calculated taxes for the interval [0,80]. Save the result into data frame `tax` and display the first rows.
```{r "4_2__2",message=FALSE}
#... <- dat %>% 
#  mutate(carbontax = (priceratio*...-...)/(coal_cc-priceratio*gas_cc)) %>% 
#  filter(carbontax >= ... & carbontax <= ...)
#
#head(...,...)
tax <- dat %>% 
  mutate(carbontax = (priceratio*basegas-basecoal)/(coal_cc-priceratio*gas_cc)) %>% 
  filter(carbontax >= 0 & carbontax <= 80)

head(tax,3)
```

The overall approach of plotting our results is similar to the one in Exercise `4.1`. We will filter for each interconnection seperatly and plot our result with `ggplot2`. First we will create a plot for interconnection `EAST` and interpret the results. Afterwards we will run the code on the other interconnections and compare them to another. In contrast to the previous Exercise though, we won't plot the emission change based on changing cost ratios, but obviously on changing `carbon prices`.

**Task:** Filter the data frame `tax` for interconnection `EAST` and save it to `tax_east`. Since we filter for a string, don't forget to put quotes around the argument.
```{r "4_2__3"}
tax_east <- filter(tax, intercn=="EAST")
```

Our first plot shows the reaction of emission with the introduction of carbon prices in the Eastern Interconnection . $CO_2$ emissions react steeper with lower carbon prices. We will get to exact numbers at the end of this exercise, but for now we can argue that a majority of emission reduction can be achieved with a mediocre level of carbon prices.

Quiz: We saw earlier that interconnection `ERCOT` has a higher generation of renewable energies than `EAST`. Do you expect `ERCOT` to have a higher or lower emission abatement in comparison to `EAST`?

- higher [ ]

- lower [x]

**Task:** Just press *check*.
```{r "4_2__7",fig.width=21, fig.height=7}
grid.arrange(plot_east, plot_ercot, plot_wecc, nrow=1)
```

TEXT

Because of the fact that ercot is already more reliant on renewable energies we can argue that the emission reduction from switching between gas and coal- 
is steepest with a introduction of carbon prices and slows afterwards.


Based on our method we dont get carbon prices higher than 72 for West because of the price structure.
In the end all interconnection end up at around a reduction of 12% 

We can argue that additional carbon reduction will result from other factors if

The result corresponds to Table 2 in Cullen. 

TEXT



From the results of the table we can additionally derive the costs for such a measure. Let's pretend we want to introduce a carbon tax of $30 with total daily reductions of 5.7%. This would cost us approx. 

```{r "4_2__9"}
days=365
costs_30 = (64.8-(64.8-61.1))/100000*30*days
costs_30
```

Therefore it would cost around 183 millions dollars to 

```{r "4_2__10"}
costs_60 = (64.8-58.5)*100000*60
costs_60
```













To conclude our analysis we can calculate the abatement costs for certain carbon taxes. Lets say we introduce a carbon tax of `40$/ton`


Calculating costs






Concluding, our results seem to be robust  to parameter changes.

## Exercise 5 -- Conclusion

Along this problem set we discovered that we are able to reduce carbon emission by a good margin with the introduction of carbon taxes.





Since today there are coal generators that are quite effecient, a carbon tax as low as $20/ton would be efficient to carbon heavy plants (Cullen & Renolds, 2016)






I hope you enjoyed working through this problem set.
