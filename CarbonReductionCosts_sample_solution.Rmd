Welcome to this interactive problem set. The awareness of climate change rose significantly over the past years. Purely questioning the moral of the population though, won't avoid its' highly uncertain effects. Therefore high efforts are made to find technical improvements as well as economical incentitives to avoid long term effects of climate change.   
In this problem set we will approach one possible countermeasure by analysing how carbon pricing would reduce emissions in the electricty sector. The analysis is based on **"Inferring Carbon Abatement Costs in Electricity Markets: A Revealed Preference Approach using the Shale Revolution"** by Joseph A. Cullen, Erin T. Mansur (2016) - further simply referred as Cullen (2016). The paper and further ressources can be downloaded from <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/pol.20150388   target = "_blank"> https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/pol.20150388</a>

You will use the `Statstical Programming Language R` to replicate the analysis. Basic knowledge of `R` is required, but information on important function will be provided. 
Since each new exercise inherits the results of previous exercises, it is recommendated to solve them in order. However you are free to skip to any exercise you like if you feel so.  
If you are a complete novice in `R` you should not feel left behind. Understanding the basic concepts is straight forward, you can find useful information [here](https://cran.r-project.org/manuals.html).

## Exercise 1 -- Motivation

`Coal` is the **world's biggest source of energy and carbon emissions**, mostly because it is easy to store, transport, doesn't alter and can be mined in huge quantities around the world. This makes it desirable and cheap to use as a energy source. Given that the coal supply will last for decades, it is a major goal to find incentitives to reduce emissions from coal consumption.  
One alternative to coal is `natural gas`. Even though still being a fossil fuel, its' emissions and heat density are way superior to coal. Nevertheless, natural gas wasn't considered to be an real alternative to coal because to its higher prices more difficult handling up until the early 2000s.  
This changed due to the `Shale Revolution`, whereby natural gas was not only a by-product of the oil industry, but could now be extracted in a targeted manner and in large quantities. Lanfrancois (2012) estimates, that based on the Clean Power Plan introduced by the Obama administration in 2015, carbon dioxide emissions from the electricity industry could be reduced by 23 to 42 percent by switching existing coal powered generators to gas powered ones.

With this in mind, in `Exercise 1` you will explore data to get insights in the current situation of the U.S. energy sector. You will look at the distribution of energy sources in the American market, its prices and the generated load over time.  

**Task:**
Use the `read_csv` command to *load the data set* and store it in a variable called `PaGP`.
The basic structure of the command is already given in the code chunk as a comment.

info("read.csv() and write.csv()") # Run this line (Strg-Enter) to show info

```{r "1__5"}
# ... <- read_csv("./Data/PaGP.csv")
PaGP <- read_csv("./Data/PaGP.csv")
```


**Task:** Lets take a look at the data we just imported. Use the `head()` command to show the first **eight** rows of the data set. 


```{r "1__6"}
# head(PaGP, ...)
head(PaGP, 5)

```


Alternatively you can press the `data` button to get redirected to the `Data Explorer` Tab. 

The date column is currently stored as a character. To be able visualize the date variable as a continuous variable, we have to convert is. Therefore, R has a build in date class.  
**Task:** Just press *check*.

```{r "1__7"}
PaGP <- as.data.frame(PaGP)
PaGP$date <- as.Date(PaGP$date)
```

  
The data frame contains monthly numbers of generated MwH with coal and gas as well as prices of Energy commodities. 
Keep in mind that different commodities are traded in different units. Oil is traded in barrels (\$/bbl), coal in metric tons (\$/mt) and gas in British thermal units($/mmbtu). The natural gas index is
set to 100 in the year 2010 and changes accordingly.
Prior to visualizing the data and to get clearer results, lets modifiy the data set. As mentioned before, commodities are traded in different units. Therefore we will add new entries for normalized
prices, which gives us a good cost basis to produce the same amount of energy with each commodity.  On this account, we assume that `1 MwH = 0.454 mT Coal = 3.412 mmBtu Natural Gas`.

**Task:** Perform the above calculations. Just press *check*.

         price_coal_australia_normalized = price_coal_australia * 0.453, 
         price_coal_africa_normalized = price_coal_africa * 0.453)
```

**Task:** Output a graphic. Just press *check*.

einfuehren priceratio auf basis von tabelle oben - hohe varianz



## Exercise 3.1 -- Priceratio Regressions

In this exercise we briefly go over the data we use for our main analysis and give an overview what we will be doing in the following exercises. The main question of this problem set is to find out
how carbon prices would effect emissions in the energy sector. To answer this we will construct a statistical model to understand the emission behaviour for changing input costs while controlling
for variables that effect the energy market. However we won't simply propose a final model but will work our way from simple linear regressions to more complex but also more accurate models.  
&nbsp;

Until now we got an idea how the energy market is 
In this and the following chapter we will take a look at regression theory and develop a model that satifies our statistical needs tor answer our initial question on how changing commodity prices will effect $CO_2$ emissions. We start with simple regressions and introduce new methods along the way to make our model more precise.


If you want to go faster through the problem set without the theoretical background, you can skip to exercise `4.1` onwards, where we present the final model and visualize our results.

//////////// neu data frame nur mit co2mass gas coalprice

**Task:** To get started, load the data set `main_data.csv`, press `edit` and `check` afterwards.

```{r "3_1",message=FALSE}
dat <- read_csv("Data/main_data.csv")
```

We have seen in the previous exercise that it makes sense to calculate our model for each intersection separately. For this purpose we filter our data for intersection `EAST` and develop the model based on that `intersection`. Afterwards we will use the model on each intersection. Since we observe substantial variation in coal and gas prices, we construct a new variable for relative costs `priceratio`. There are several ways to propose price ratios, we use the ratio between the price of coal and gas, which is defined as followed:  

As we have seen in the last chapter it makes sense to apply our analysis for each intersection `separately`. For this reason the data are divided into interconnections. We `develop` our model based on the `EAST` interconnection and map the model to all at a later point in time.  







$$\tag{2}CR=\frac{C_{coal}}{C_{gas}}=\frac{P_{coal}+CO_{2,coal}\cdot P_{co2}}{P_{gas}+CO_{2,gas}\cdot P_{co2}}$$

THe question here is, why use a priceratio and not just coal and gas prices seperatly.  ///////// why priceratio - paper 18 absatz 2


**Task:** The data set contains a column `intercn` with values `EAST`, `WEST` and `ERCOT`. Filter only for data with interconnection `EAST` and store the new data frame in variable `dat_east`. Additionally, calculate the cost ratio between `coalprice` and `gasprice` according to formula 2.
```{r "3_1__2"}
# ... <- data %>% 
#  mutate(CR = .../...) %>% 
#  filter(intercn=="...")
dat_east <- dat %>% 
  mutate(priceratio = coalprice/gasprice) %>%
  filter(intercn=="EAST")
```


### Stage 1: Linear Regression

We start by proposing a simple linear regression model. In a mathematical way we can express the relationship as followed:

$$\tag{x}CO_{2t}=\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}\cdot priceratio_{t}$$


info("Linear Regression with lm()") # Run this line (Strg-Enter) to show info

**Task:** Run a regression with `co2mass` as the dependent variable and `priceratio` as independent variable. Store it in the variable `fit1`. 
```{r "3_1__4"}
# ... <- lm(...~... , data=east)
fit <- lm(co2mass ~ priceratio, data=dat_east)
```


Quiz: What impact do changing price ratios have on emissions?

- With increasing price ratios emissions will increase. [ ]

- With increasing price ratios emissions will fall. [x]



TEXT

**Task:** To
```{r "3_1__5"}
summary(fit)
```

$\beta_{1}$

The summary statistics shows as a positive value for priceratio $\beta_{1}$, which means that a increasing price ratio decreases emissions.


For upcoming regressions we will use the `stargazer()` function from the `stargazer` package to show summary statistics from our regressions. We don't need get every information the basic functions displays, therefore we define a own custom function with statistics we need. Read below to find out more about `stargazer` and `custom functions` and continue with the next `task`.

**Task:** Click check to run the Code. It defines the function to show our custom regression tables.
```{r "3_1__8"}
show.regression= function(...){
  library(stargazer)
    stargazer(..., 
            type = "text",

First, we have to define our model 
















## Exercise 4 -- Road to a working model

In this exercise we briefly present the data we use for our analysis and give an overview what we will be doing in the following exercises. The main question of this problem set is to find out
how carbon prices would effect emissions in the energy sector. To answer this we will construct a statistical model to understand the emission behaviour for changing input costs while controlling
for variables that effect the energy market. However we won't simply propose a final model but will work our way from simple linear regressions to more complex but also more accurate models.  
&nbsp;

 - You can find a rough guideline of content in each exercise below:
  + `Exercise 4.1` - Estimated CO2 Response to Fuel Prices
  + `Exercise 4.2` - Imputed CO2 Response to Carbon Prices
&nbsp;
  
Before we take a look at the data, import our dataset.

**Task:** Load the data set `main_data.csv`, press `edit` and `check` afterwards.

```{r "4",message=FALSE}
dat <- read_csv("Data/main_data.csv")
head(dat,3)
```
&nbsp;

The data frame is a combination of data we used previous exercises and additional factors. It consists of `daily` information for `each interconnection`. The meaning of each column is explained below:

`co2mass`: $CO_2$ emissions in tons  
`gasprice`: Capacity weighted average daily gas price per interconnetion ($ per million BTU)  
`coalprice`: Price of Coal ($ per million BTU)  
`load`: daily electricity consumption per interconnection in MWH  
`meant`: average daily temperature per interconnection  
`nonFossil`: Electricity generation with non-fossil fuel in MWH  
`so2price`: Permit prices of $SO_2$ ($/ton)  
`netNSflow`: MwH flowing from Canada to US by interconnection and month  

The data are gathered from several official U.S. agencies and aggregated to a daily level and seperated by interconnection. Because of the size of these data sets we wont do the data
preparation in this problem set but rather provide the data sources. `Emission` data are measured by the Continuous Emissions Monitoring System (CEMS) of the `Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)`.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) collects data of `Non-fossil` energy production as well as spot prices of `coal prices` in Form 923. Spot prices of `gas` can be found in
`Intercontinental Exchange (ICE)`. Data of `electricity consumption` or `load` are provided in Form 714 of the `Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC)`, permit prices of $SO_2$ from the `EPA Clean Air Markets` and finally, `net imports` of electricity from Canada are gathered from the `National Energy Board of Canada`. Links to the sources can be found in `references section`.


When choosing control variables we have to be sure that they directly effect the emissions 

To give us an overview of the data, lets create a table with average values for relevant factors for each interconnection. R provides several packages that , but for now we work with packages we
introduced before and solve this with `dyplr`.  

**Task:** Use `group_by()` to group the dataset `dat` by `intercn`. Afterwards use `summarise_all()` to calculate the means of every variable. You don't have to deal with the additional lines of code, which is used to create a more understandable output.

info("Group_by() and summarise()") # Run this line (Strg-Enter) to show info

```{r "4__3"}
#... %>% 
#  select(intercn, co2mass, load, gasprice, coalprice) %>% 
#  group_by(...) %>% 
#  ...("mean") %>% 
#  mutate(co2mass = co2mass/1000, load=load/1000, "Emission Rate"=co2mass/load, "Cost Ratio"=coalprice/gasprice) %>% 
#  rename("CO2 Emissions"=co2mass, Load=load, "Gas Price"=gasprice, "Coal Price"=coalprice)
dat %>% 
  select(intercn, co2mass, load, gasprice, coalprice, nonfossil) %>% 
  group_by(intercn) %>% 
  mutate(co2mass = co2mass/1000, load=load/1000, "Cost Ratio"=coalprice/gasprice, "Emission Rate"=co2mass/load, "Non fossil"=nonfossil) %>% 
  summarise_all("mean") %>% 
  rename("Interconnection"=intercn, "CO2 Emissions"=co2mass, Load=load, "Gas Price"=gasprice, "Coal Price"=coalprice)
```

The table replicates table 1 from Cullen (2016). As we easily observe the interconnections are vastly different energy markets. While the EAST interconnection is a lot bigger than the other, it also

## Exercise 4.1 -- Estimated CO2 Response to Fuel Prices

in this exercise we will use the findings of the previous exercises and estimate the $CO_2$ response curves to changing fuel prices. 

In this exercise we will estimate the $CO_2$ respone curve to changing fuel prices. We will construct a response for each `interconnection` seperatly

Our goal is to plot a response curve 

As a side note, the code isn't meant to be the shortest or the most efficient, but should allow you to follow the steps to get the desired result. We will split the analysis in the different interconnections we presented in a previous exercise


In this exercise we will expand our results from the previous exercise and estimate the $CO_{2}$ respone to changing fuel prices. 
To summarise the results from last exercises and to understand why we do certain methods this way, lets summarise. In exercise ?.? we showed that it makes sense to split our analysis in different connection. 

Getting the results we want isn't so easy, but we will take it step by step. First we will 


The model incorporates the findings of previous exercises. Lets look at a quick summary:

We seperate the model in each interconnection
.
.



In this exercise we will estimate the $CO_2$ response curve to `changing` fuel prices. 


In retrospective to the model we defined in the last chapter, we will expand our regression model with several control variables as followed. The meaning and source of data to every variable is explained in the info box below:


We will perform a reduced-form regression based in the theory of mapping carbon we introduced in exercise `?????` and cubic splines from exercise `3.2`.

$$\tag{5}CO_{2t}=s(priceratio_{t}|\beta)+s(load_{t}|\theta) + s(temp_t|\omega)+X_t\psi+D_\gamma+\epsilon_t$$

info("Model variables") # Run this line (Strg-Enter) to show info



**Task:** Load the dataframe and store it in `dat`. Create a new variable called `priceratio` and calculate the ratio $priceratio=\frac{C_{coal}}{C_{gas}}$. To save us another step, we will also create the seasonable dummy variable. 
```{r "4_1",message=FALSE}
dat <- read_csv("Data/main_data.csv")  %>% 
       mutate(priceratio = coalprice/gasprice,
              season=(month>3) + (month>6) + (month>9),
              yearseason=year*10+season)

sample_n(dat,10)
```

**Task:** Filter the data set for intercn `EAST`.
```{r "4_1__2"}
#east <- filter(...,...)
east <- filter(dat, intercn=="EAST")
```

**Task:** Calculate the `mean` of every variable we use in our regression. First, select the necessary columns and then use `summarise_all` to get the `mean`. Store the result in `mean_dat_east`.
```{r "4_1__3"}
# ... <- east %>% 
#  select(load, tlsd, tlmin, tlmax, meant, nonfossil, so2price, netNSflow, yearseason) %>% 
#  summarise_all(...)
mean_east <- east %>% 
  select(load, tlsd, tlmin, tlmax, meant, nonfossil, so2price, netNSflow, yearseason) %>% 
  summarise_all(mean)
```


**Task:** To make our life a bit easier we will create a new data set with `gasprice`, `priceratio` and the results of the `last` task. Use `tibble()` to create the described output.

info("tibble()") # Run this line (Strg-Enter) to show info
info("cbind()") # Run this line (Strg-Enter) to show info
```{r "4_1__4"}
temp_east <- tibble(gasprice = east$gasprice, priceratio = east$priceratio) %>% 
  cbind(mean_east)
```

Our data are now ready to be used on our model. We have the necessary data for our regression model in the data set `east` and afterwards we can predict `emissions` with the help of data in `mean_dat_east`.

info("ns()") # Run this line (Strg-Enter) to show info

**Task:** Perform the regression model we described in the beginning of this exercise for interconnection `EAST`. Use `ns()` for variables with spline regression (as explained in `3.3`) We want to use `5` degrees of freedom. Store the resulting model in `reg_east`.
```{r "4_1__5"}
#... <- lm(co2mass ~ ...(priceratio, df=...) + ...(load, df=...) + tlsd + tlmin + tlmax + ...(meant, df=...) + nonfossil + so2price + netNSflow + yearseason, data=east)
reg_east <- lm(co2mass ~ ns(priceratio, df=5) + ns(load, df=5) + tlsd + tlmin + tlmax + ns(meant, df=5) + nonfossil + so2price + netNSflow + yearseason, data=east)
```

**Task:** Predict $CO_2$ emissions based on the regression model `reg_east` and `temp_east`.
```{r "4_1__6"}
co2.east = as.data.frame(predict(reg_east, newdata = temp_east, interval = 'confidence'))

#co2.east$fit
#temp_east = temp_east %>% cbind(as.data.frame(predict(reg_east, newdata = temp_east, interval = 'confidence')))

## Exercise 4.2 --  Imputed CO2 Response to Carbon Prices

A short recapture: In exercise `4.1` we calculated the $CO_2$ response curves to changing fuel prices. In this exercise we will transform these response curves into carbon prices with the help of equation 6. In the first step we will plot the 




$$\tag{6}{P_{co2}}=\frac{CR\cdot{P_{gas}}-{P_{coal}}}{CO_{2,coal}-CR\cdot CO_{2,gas}}$$

In the first step have to agree on a base level 


To avoid doing the same steps as in the last exercise, I prepared a data frame that includes the emission that result from. the regression model
