Welcome to this interactive problem set. The awareness of climate change rose significantly over the past years. Sorely questioning the moral of the population won't avoid its' highly uncertain effects. Therefore high efforts are made to find technical improvements as well as economical incentitives to avoid long term effects of climate change.   
In this problem set we will approach one possible countermeasure by analysing how carbon pricing would reduce emissions in the electricty sector. The analysis is based on **"Inferring Carbon Abatement Costs in Electricity Markets: A Revealed Preference Approach using the Shale Revolution"** by Joseph A. Cullen, Erin T. Mansur (2016) - further simply referred as Cullen. The paper and further ressources can be downloaded from <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/pol.20150388   target = "_blank"> https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/pol.20150388</a>

You will use the `Statstical Programming Language R` to replicate the analysis. Basic Knowledge is required , but further information on important logic or function will be provided. Furthermore, you are not forced to solve the tasks in order, but it is recommended, since each new task is based on the results of the previous ones. Even if you are a complete novice in R you should not be put off here. You can find useful information

### ReadME


The problem set offers different ways to interact with. Coding exercises are marked as **TASK**. Some only require you to run them, in others you need to complement a small part of the code. Below the different types of interactions with their corresponding functions are explained:   


 - Code Chunks: Require you to complete small parts of Code. The work flow of solving code chunks is intuitive and as follows:
                
  + `edit` : Click to insert your own Code into the chunk.
  + `run chunk`: Runs the chunk and displays the outputs in the corresponding console of the task.
  + `check`: Check your input for correctness.  
&nbsp;

  
  Additional functions:    
                   
  + `data`: Redirects you to the data browser - you can view the data that are loaded.
  + `hint` : Shows a hint to help solve the code chunk.
  + `solution` : Shows the solution of the task.  
&nbsp;

  
 - Quizzes: To give you a feeling of the data we work with, i placed some quizzes to blabal
    
 - Info Boxes: Contain additional information, that provide further information on technical terms and documentation of functions.

## Exercise 1 -- Motivation

The goal of this problem set is to analyse how carbon pricing would effect emission in the energy sector. `Coal` is the **world's biggest source of energy and carbon emissions**, mostly because it is easy to store, transport, doesn't alter and can be mined in huge quantities around the world. This makes it very desirable and cheap to use as a energy source. Given that the coal supply will last for decades, it is a major goal to find incentitives to reduce emissions from coal consumption.  
The Obama administration introduced the `Clean Power Plan`, which estimates that sorely switching from Coal to Gas powered plants could reduce carbon dioxide emissions from the 




One alternative to coal is `natural gas`. Even though it is still considered fossil fuel, its emissions and heat density are way superior to coal. Despite that, natural gas wasn't considered to be a real alternative to coal as an energy supplier due to its higher prices and the more difficult handling. This changed with the `Shale Revolution`, where natural gas

However, for a long time natural gas wasn't considered to be a real alternative to coal as an energy supplier, due to its' higher costs and more difficult handling.


To start off, in `Exercise 1` you will explore various data sets to get insights in the current situation of the energy market. You will look at the distribution of energy sources in the American market, its prices and the generated load over time.
The data sets are provided by 

info("Shale-Revolution") # Run this line (Strg-Enter) to show info


**Task:**
Use the `read.csv` command to *load the data set* and store it in a variable called `PaGP`.
The basic structure of the command is already given in the code chunk as a comment.

info("read.csv() and write.csv()") # Run this line (Strg-Enter) to show info

```{r "1__5"}
# ... <- read.csv("./Data/data_1.csv")
```

heat rates are different, therefore these angaben are a bit confusing. To clear things up lets umrechnen LG

To get a detailed answer to this question we will use the just imported data frame. To get a feeling on how the data look, use head to get example


```{r "1__6"}
```

The date column is currently stored as a character. To be able visualize the date variable as a continuous variable, we have to convert is. Therefore, R has a build in date class.
**Task:** Just press *check*.

```{r "1__7"}
PaGP <- as.data.frame(PaGP)
PaGP$date <- as.Date(PaGP$date)
```



info("ggplot2") # Run this line (Strg-Enter) to show info






**Task:** Just press *check*.

```{r "1__8"}
ggplot(data=PaGP, aes(x=date)) +
  geom_line(aes(y=PaGP$price_naturalgas_USA, color="US"), size=1) +
  geom_line(aes(y=PaGP$price_naturalgas_Europe, color="Europe"), size=1) +
  labs(x = "Year", y = "", title = "US and European Natural Gas Prices", subtitle = "Y=$/MMBTU")+
