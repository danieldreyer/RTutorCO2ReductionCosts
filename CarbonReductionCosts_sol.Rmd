Welcome to this interactive problem set. The awareness of climate change rose significantly over the past years. Sorely questioning the moral of the population though, won't avoid its' highly uncertain effects. Therefore high efforts are made to find technical improvements as well as economical incentitives to avoid long term effects of climate change.   
In this problem set we will approach one possible countermeasure by analysing how carbon pricing would reduce emissions in the electricty sector. The analysis is based on **"Inferring Carbon Abatement Costs in Electricity Markets: A Revealed Preference Approach using the Shale Revolution"** by Joseph A. Cullen, Erin T. Mansur (2016) - further simply referred as Cullen. The paper and further ressources can be downloaded from <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/pol.20150388   target = "_blank"> https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/pol.20150388</a>

You will use the `Statstical Programming Language R` to replicate the analysis. Basic knowledge of `R` is required, but information on important function will be provided. 
Since each new exercise inherits the results of previous exercises, it is recommendated to solve them in order. However you are free to skip to any exercise you like if you feel so.  
If you are a complete novice in `R` you should not feel left behind. Understanding the basic concepts is straight forward, you can find useful information [here](https://cran.r-project.org/manuals.html).

### ReadME


The problem set offers different ways to interact with it. Coding exercises are marked as **TASK**. Some only need to be run, for others you need to complement a small part of the code, which is noted in the task description. Below you can read about the different types of interactions with their corresponding functions:   


 - Code Chunks: Require you to complete small parts of Code. The work flow of solving code chunks is intuitive and as follows:
                
  + `edit` : Click to insert your own Code into the chunk.
  + `run chunk`: Runs the chunk and displays outputs or errors in the corresponding console.
  + `check`: Check your input for against the solution.
  + `hint` : Should you have problem to solve a task, you can request a hint.  
&nbsp;

  
  Additional functions:    
                   
  + `data`: Redirects you to the data browser - you can view the loaded data with the help of an interface.
  + `solution` : Shows the solution of the task.  
&nbsp;

  
 - Quizzes: Evaluate your knownledge of topics before we dive in our analysis.
    
 - Info Boxes: Contain additional information on technical terms or documentation of functions.

## Exercise 1 -- Motivation

`Coal` is the **world's biggest source of energy and carbon emissions**, mostly because it is easy to store, transport, doesn't alter and can be mined in huge quantities around the world. This makes it desirable and cheap to use as a energy source. Given that the coal supply will last for decades, it is a major goal to find incentitives to reduce emissions from coal consumption.  
One alternative to coal is `natural gas`. Even though still being a fossil fuel, its' emissions and heat density are way superior to coal. Nevertheless, natural gas wasn't considered to be an real alternative to coal because to its higher prices more difficult handling up until the early 2000s.  
This changed due to the `Shale Revolution`, whereby natural gas was not only a by-product of the oil industry, but could now be extracted in a targeted manner and in large quantities. Lanfrancois (2012) estimates, that based on the Clean Power Plan introduced by the Obama administration in 2015, carbon dioxide emissions from the electricity industry could be reduced by 23 to 42 percent by switching existing coal powered generators to gas powered ones.  
  
#< info "Shale-Revolution"
Shale gas is a form of natural gas and is extracted from shale formation, known as fracking. Since the start of the century, shale gas became a increasingly more important source of natural gas in the United States. Whereas in 2000 shale gas only provided 1% of the natural gas, nowadays in 2020 it makes up roughly 50%.
However at the same time, the environmental concerns of fracking are heavily debated.  

You can find further information on the topic here:

With this in mind, in `Exercise 1` you will explore data to get insights in the current situation of the U.S. energy sector. You will look at the distribution of energy sources in the American market, its prices and the generated load over time.  

**Task:**
Use the `read.csv` command to *load the data set* and store it in a variable called `PaGP`.
The basic structure of the command is already given in the code chunk as a comment.

#< info "read.csv() and write.csv()"
The command `read.csv()` reads in a **csv file** and stores it into a given name. Csv is a format for data, that uses commas as seperators and periods as decimals. Another version of are **csv2 files**, where semicolons are used for seperators and commas for decimals. We only use csv files here.

Given the file you want to read it is in the same working directory, you can use the command below:

```{r "1",eval=FALSE}
example <- read.csv("example.csv")
```

If the file is saved outside of your working directory there are two possibilities. For one you can insert the whole file path, if the file is you can navigate through the whole file path if your file is above 

If the file is saved in an structure above your working directory you have to additionally insert the full file path:

```{r "1__2",eval=FALSE}
example <- read.csv("C:/Data/example.csv")
```

For files that are located below the working directory it is sufficient to specify the following file path:

```{r "1__3",eval=FALSE}
example <- read.csv("./Data/example.csv")
```


Csv files can be saved using the `write.csv` command.

```{r "1__4",eval=FALSE}
write.csv(example, file="example.csv")
```

For further information, use `help(write.csv)`.
#>

```{r "1__5"}
#< task
# ... <- read.csv("./Data/data_1.csv")
#>
PaGP <- read.csv("./Data/PaGP.csv")
#< hint
display("Replace the variable name with the one given in the exercise description. No other changes are needed.")
#>
```


**Task:** Lets take a look at the data we just imported. Use the `head()` command to show the first **eight** rows of the data set. 


```{r "1__7"}
#< task
# head(PaGP, ...)
#>
head(PaGP, 8)
#< hint
display("The second input parameter defines the number of row that are shown. Replace ... with the number from the task description.")
#>

```


Alternatively you can press the `data` button to get redirected to the `Data Explorer` Tab. 

The date column is currently stored as a character. To be able visualize the date variable as a continuous variable, we have to convert is. Therefore, R has a build in date class.  
**Task:** Just press *check*.

```{r "1__6"}
#< task_notest
PaGP <- as.data.frame(PaGP)
PaGP$date <- as.Date(PaGP$date)
#>
```

  
The data frame contains monthly numbers of generated MwH with coal and gas as well as prices of Energy commodities. 
Keep in mind that different commodities are traded in different units. Oil is traded in barrels (\$/bbl), coal in metric tons (\$/mt) and gas in British thermal units($/mmbtu). The natural gas index is set to 100 in the year 2010 and changes accordingly.
Prior to visualizing the data and to get clearer results, lets modifiy the data set. As mentioned before, commodities are traded in different units. Therefore we will add new entries for normalized prices, which gives us a good cost basis to produce the same amount of energy with each commodity.  On this account, we assume that `1 MwH = 0.454 mT Coal = 3.412 mmBtu Natural Gas`.

**Task:** Perform the above calculations. Just press *check*.
  
#< info "Pipe, mutate, select"
The pipe operator `%>%` is a feature provided by the `dplyr` Package. Essentially it allows to exectute multiple operation on a dataframe at once.
This works because every pipe operator returns a dataframe. If you add pipes, all you do is creating new data frames.  
  
example %>%  
&nbsp; mutate(new_column = old_column+1) %>% `mutate: create or alter columns`    
&nbsp; select(1:5)  `select: keep certain columns, here column 1 to 5`   

You can find a more detailed cheatsheet [here](https://rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/data-wrangling-cheatsheet.pdf) or use the `help()` function.
#>

#< info "ggplot2"
The package `ggplot2` is a powerful data visualization package for `R`, which is part of the `tidyverse` environment. Besides basic functions that are also provided by native `R`, it allows the user to highly modify graphs by **altering**, **adding** or **removing** components.

The problem set doesn't require you to have any knowledge about functionalities of the package. However, you find further documentation [here](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) or type `help(ggplot2)` into the console.

```{r "1__8"}
PaGP <- PaGP %>% 
  mutate(price_naturalgas_USA_normalized = price_naturalgas_USA * 3.412) %>% 
  mutate(price_naturalgas_Europe_normalized = price_naturalgas_Europe * 3.412) %>% 
  mutate(price_coal_australia_normalized = price_coal_australia * 0.453) %>% 
  mutate(price_coal_africa_normalized = price_coal_africa * 0.453)
```

**Task:** Output a graphic. Just press *check*.
```{r "1__9"}
#< task_notest
ggplot(data=PaGP, aes(x=date)) +
  geom_line(aes(y=PaGP$price_coal_australia_normalized, color="Coal Autralia"), size=1) +
  geom_line(aes(y=PaGP$price_coal_africa_normalized, color="Coal Africa"), size=1) +
  geom_line(aes(y=PaGP$price_naturalgas_USA_normalized, color="Gas US"), size=1) +
  geom_line(aes(y=PaGP$price_naturalgas_Europe_normalized, color="Gas Europe"), size=1) +
  labs(x = "Year", y = "", title = "Normalized Ressource Prices", subtitle = "Y=$/MwH")+
  scale_color_manual(name="Region",values = c("green", "yellow", "blue","red"))
#>
```

In the next Step we will look at the generated Power for Coal / Gas in the U.S. 



#< quiz "Proportion of Sectors"
question: Do you think that the proportion of gas generated electicity compared to coal generated electricity has increased or decreased over time?

sc:
    - increased*
    - decreased
success: Great, your answer is correct!
failure: Try again.

**Task:** Just press *check*.

```{r "1__9"}
#< task_notest
ggplot(data=PaGP, aes(x=date)) +
  geom_line(aes(y=PaGP$generated_coal, color="Coal Generation (TWh)"), size=1) +
  geom_line(aes(y=PaGP$generated_gas, color="Natural Gas Generation (TWh)"), size=1, linetype="dotted") +
  labs(x = "Year", y = "", title = "Monthly Generation by Fueltype", subtitle = "Y=Monthly Electricty (TWh)")+
  scale_color_manual(name="",values = c("black","red"))+
  scale_y_continuous(breaks=seq(0,200,25))

## Exercise 2 -- Interconnections


![Interconnections](./Material/interconnections.png) (SOURCE)

#< info "Interconnections"
The American Electric system is made up of three major `Interconnections`, which in turn concist of different balancing authorities (responsible for maintaining the electricity balance within the region).
Local electricity grids are hereby connected to form a network, which provides higher stablity and reliability of electricity. These `Interconnections` are operated independently of each other and, in contrast to the European electricity grid, there is little transfer of power.  
The 3 regions, as seen in the graph above, are as followed:
- Easter Interconnection: Consists of 36 balancing authorities and extends from the East Coast to the Rocky Mountains.
- Western Interconnection: Involves 37 balancing authorities, which are located in the West of North America.
- Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT): Consists of large parts of Texas
