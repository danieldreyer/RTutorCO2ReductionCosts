Residuals are another way to analyse the fit of a model. Simply spoken they represent the error in the result. Graphically, residuals are the vertical distance between the data points and the regression line. For a well fitted model we expect them to be close as possible.  


**Task:** Just press **check**.
```{r "3_1__10"}
plot(fit1, 2)
```


As we could expect from previous measurements, the residuals for our first case aren't optimal. First of all, the vary widely 

By the shape of the curve we can also imply a non-linear behaviour. Therefore, we will further improve our model in that direction.
